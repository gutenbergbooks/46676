  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was a dark, dismal day. Thick black clouds hung
across the sky. There was a faint chirping of sparrows
amongst the lifeless creepers, and that was all. A
roaring fire burnt in my grate; before which my dog,
a great tawny creature of the boarhound breed, lay
sleeping at her ease. It was cold, very cold; in all
nature there seemed no life. A white, thick covering
rested upon the ground. Snow had fallen heavily the
last week of the old year, and much, I feared, must fall
again, judging by the yellowish grey, leaden pall I saw
overhead.</p>

<p class='c014'>I lay in bed; the doctor had just been, and had prescribed
for me a day of rest, and a day in the house, on
account of a chill caught the week before.</p>

<p class='c014'>How immortal we should feel, I reflected, if it were
not for influenza, colds, and rheumatism, and such like
small deer amongst diseases. What a glory life would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>2</a></span>
be in their absence! Alas! we poor mortals, we spend
much time in trivial illness; not maladies of the heroic
and grand mediæval school, such as the Black Death or
the sweating sickness, but in weary, long episodes of
chills, and colds, which make us feel ill, and low, and
produce irritability and heart-searchings. It is sad also
to think how many days slip by for all of us in the
English winter—unloved and dreary days of twilight,
and of little pleasure unless taken rightly and softened
by letters to, and from old friends, and by hours spent
with favourite books.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet each cloud has its silver lining, if we have but
eyes to see; and as an old cottager once said to me,
“Yer might do worse than be in bed when Mother
Shipton plucks her geese.” Yes, I reflected, I might
be worse, and I looked round my Norman-windowed
chamber—for to-day should be spent with my books.</p>

<p class='c014'>Life to a woman, as has been justly said, is a series
of interrupted sentences; and in these days of hurry
and scurry, life seems almost more interrupted than it
did to our mothers twenty years ago, and leisure, of all
delightful things, is the most delightful, the rarest and
the most difficult to obtain. Leisure with thought is a
necessity for mental development, and yet in these days
of motor-driving, flying-machines, and radium we only
think of getting on—getting on—but where?</p>

<p class='c014'>I lay back comfortably and looked with pleasure at
the pile of books by my bedside. They were all dear,
tried, and trusted friends. There was Malory. How I
love his pictures of forest and castle, and his battles,
while his last scenes of Launcelot and Arthur, are
almost the greatest, and grandest that I know.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLOWERS FROM THE SOUTH</div>

<p class='c014'>How pathetic they are! and yet how simple, instinct
with living poetry, and noble passion! Then I saw my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
much-worn Shakespeare, and I looked forward to a dip
in <cite>The Tempest</cite>, and later on meant to refresh my
mind with the story of the ill-fated Duke of Buckingham,
who was betrayed near here by his treacherous
steward, Banister. I looked round and saw other
friends close to hand. Amiel’s beautiful story of a
noble life, teeming with highest thought; “Gerontius’
Dream,” by England’s great poet and ecclesiastic;
Tennyson’s “Idylls of the King;” and a few of Montaigne’s
admirable essays, “that charming old man”
of whom, Madame de Sévigné wrote, “it was impossible
to weary, for, old friend as he was, he seemed always
so fresh and new.” I shall never be dull, I said with a
laugh, and I shall live in fairy-land with my dogs and
my poets. “You might do worse than lie in bed, as my
old friend said,” I repeated to myself; and I realized
that even for days spent in bed there were compensations.
Just as I was preparing to stretch out my arm and take
a volume of Amiel, there came a loud knock at the
door, and my daughter, a child of seven, ran in with
the news—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, mama, here is a box of flowers for you, and
they have come all the way from France; I know it, for
Célestine said so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Flowers,” I cried; “how delightful!” On hearing
me speak, the big dog jumped up with a friendly growl,
and insisted upon standing up with her forepaws on the
bed and inspecting the flowers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“See!” cried Bess, “carnations and roses. Now,
why can’t we always have carnations and roses? Miss
Weldon says there is a time for everything; but I’m
sure there’s never half time enough for flowers and
play.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps not, Bess,” I said. “But the snow and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
the frost make us long for and love the flowers all the
more, and if you did no lessons you wouldn’t enjoy your
playtime half as much as you do now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess laughed contemptuously; she is a somewhat
modern child, and has no time to look “ahead,” as
she calls it, nor any belief in the glories of adversity.
Gravely she seated herself on my bed and enunciated
the following sentences—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mama,” she said in her clear bird-like voice, “I
worry a little about something every day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, not really, dear,” I answered, rather horrified
at this unusual display of gravity on her part. And I
began to fear that there had been too many lessons of
late, and had a terrible vision of over-pressure and
undue precocity, as I took the little thing’s hand and
said, “Tell me, what is it?” Whereupon Bess replied
solemnly, her eyes looking into space—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I worry about something every day, and that is,
wasting so much good time on lessons, when I might be
quite happy, and do nothing but play.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear,” I began, “if it was all play, how
would you ever learn to read or to write? And when you
grew up and got quite big, you wouldn’t like to be quite
ignorant and to know nothing, would you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should know as much as I ought,” replied Bess,
sturdily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, dear, you wouldn’t,” I said. “You couldn’t
talk as a lady, you wouldn’t know any history or
geography, or know how to speak French or German,
or be able to read nice books, or do any of the things
which are going to be very nice, but which perhaps are
not very nice just at the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should know what Burbidge knows,” replied
Bess, stoutly; “besides which,” she added, “dogs
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
don’t know French, and no dates, and yet papa doesn’t
call them ignorant.“ And then my little maid turned
with a scarlet face, and feeling perhaps a little worsted
in the argument said, ”Mama, let me scurry off for
your maid.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">BESS ON EDUCATION</div>

<p class='c014'>A moment later Bess returned in company with
Célestine, my French maid. Célestine entered like a
whirlwind; she was sure that “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame se fatigue.</span>”
“With one cold in de head un repos absolu is necessary,”
she declared. However, when she saw the
flowers, and I explained that they came from “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle
France,</span>” she affirmed “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que tout allait bien,</span>” and was
mollified. She brought me water and some vases, and
Bess and I proceeded to sort out the beautiful Neapolitan
violets and snip the ends of the rose and carnation
stalks. “I like cutting,” cried Bess, eagerly. “It’s
doing something, Burbidge says,” and just now the
gardener is my little daughter’s hero, and Burbidge’s
reasons for everything in her eyes rule the universe. I
like to think of the poor stalks in water, I said; they
are so thirsty, like poor tired men who have travelled
over sandy deserts. Then I asked Célestine to hand me
some water, and begged her to let it be tepid and to add
a few drops of eau-de-Cologne in each glass.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madame will spoil the rose and the carnation, his
own smell is all that is needed,” answered my waiting-woman
severely. But I begged her to comply with my
request, for I wanted my dear friend’s gifts to live in
water as long as possible, and to revive quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, they are charming,” I said, as Célestine and
Bess triumphantly arranged the vases around my bed.
They placed a bowl of roses on Oliver Cromwell’s cabinet,
at least it was said to be his, a cabinet of rose and walnut
wood which has innumerable secret drawers. What
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
papers, I wondered, have lain there? Perhaps State
papers from Master Secretary Milton, poet and minister;
ambitious, aspiring letters from his wife; tear-stained appeals
from Royalists; pretty notes from his best beloved
daughter, gentle Mistress Claypole. Who knows? And
that day it held my little pieces of jewelry, my fans, odds
and ends of ribbon, shoes, bows, and collars, and on
it, filling the air with sweet perfume, rested a bowl of
January roses. How fragrant they were, carrying with
them all the breath of summer. Roses are the sweetest
of all flowers—the triumph of summer suns, and
summer rains, at least so they seemed to me. Those that
I gazed on were a selection of exquisite teas: pink, fawn,
copper, and creamy white, all the various tints of dying
suns were represented, as they stood in an old Caughley
bowl; and then I looked at the carnations and buried my
nose in their sweet aromatic scent—some of these were
of absolute pearl grey, and make me think of the doves
of St. Mark when they circle or alight in the Piazza
of the City of Lagoons.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s a beauty,” said Bess, authoritatively.
“Why it’s the colour of Smokey.” Smokey is the
nursery Persian cat. “I did not know, mama,” continued
Bess, “that flowers was grey—I thought they
was always red, white, or blue. Burbidge would call
that a dust-bin blow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Flowers are all colours—at least gardeners make
them so,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, madame forgets,” interrupted Célestine, who
with Gallic vivacity always likes her share of the conversation,
“there are no blue roses.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are right,” I answered, “there are no blue
roses; they are only the flowers of our imaginations, but
they never fade,” and I laughed. I spoke in French,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
and this irritated Bess. Bess has a Shropshire nurse,
Winifrede Milner, who has unfortunately an invincible
objection to Célestine, in fact to foreigners of all kinds.
It is a religion of hatred and objections, and creates
continual disagreements in the household. Bess, owing
to the nursery feud, sternly sets her face against
everything foreign, and, above all, against speaking
another tongue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BESS DISLIKES FOREIGNERS</div>

<p class='c014'>“I won’t jabber like Célestine when she talks,”
she cried, “it sounds like shaking up a money-box,
only no money comes out. Burbidge says ‘foreigners
are like sparrows when a cat’s about. They talk when
they’ve nothing to say, and go on when they’ve done.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Bess, you must not be rude. If you were in
France, you wouldn’t like to hear rude things said about
England, or English people.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shouldn’t mind,” replied Bess, sturdily, “because
they wouldn’t be true. When things aren’t true, Miss
Weldon says, you should rise above such considerations,
and take no notice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>To divert the child I asked her abruptly what she was
going to do. “You must go out, Bess,” I said, “if
the sun shines, and take poor Mouse.” Mouse looked
at me reproachfully as I spoke—she understood my
reference to outdoor exercise, but hated the idea of
wetting her feet, besides which she considered going
out with any one except me beneath her dignity. Of
all boarhounds that I have ever known, mine is the
most self-indulgent and the most self-satisfied of my
acquaintance. Besides which, secretly I felt convinced
she was hopeful of sharing my meals, and lying later on
the bed when no one was looking.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Old Mouse is no good,” retorted Bess, disdainfully.
“She only follows grown-up people. If I lived in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
heaven,” she added dreamily, “I should have a real,
live dog, that would walk with me, although I was only
a child cherubim.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” I pursued, “but what are you going to
do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Me?” inquired Bess, with small attention to
grammatical niceties. “When I’ve done my lessons
I shall go out with Burbidge. We are going to put
up cocoa-nuts for tom-tits, and hang up some pieces of
fat bacon for the starlings, besides which we are going
to sweep round the sundial for the rooks. Papa said
they were to be fed, and we are going to do it—Burbidge
and me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What will Miss Weldon do?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, she will read,” with great contempt said Bess;
“she reads, and never sees anything. Burbidge says
that there are many who would know more if they read
less.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“See after my canaries,” I cried, as Bess flew off to
finish her lessons, buoyed up with the hope later of
going out with our old gardener. Outside I heard
him, our faithful old retainer of some seventy years,
tramping heavily on the red Ercal gravel. He was about
to sweep a place by the sundial on which to feed my
birds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEEDING THE BIRDS</div>

<p class='c014'>Birds of all kinds come to this outside dining-hall—tom-tits,
the beautiful little blue and green variety,
perky and no larger than a wren; wrens with deep
guttural bell-like notes and brown tails up-tilted; robins
with flaming breasts; ill-bred, iridescent, chattering
starlings; a few salmon-breasted chaffinches, the tamest
of all wild birds; spotted thrushes, and raven-hued
blackbirds; besides an army of grey sparrows, very
tame, very cheeky, and very quarrelsome. Added to all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
these were the rooks, and a flight of grey-pated hungry
jackdaws who uttered short sharp cries when they saw
the corn and scraps of bread, but who dared not approach
as near as the other and smaller birds.</p>

<p class='c014'>Across my latticed windows dark shadows passed
and repassed; they were caused by the jackdaws and
the rooks who swept down at intervals, and carried off
a big piece of bread when nobody was at hand. The
old gardener fed this strange feathered crew, and then
stood aside to see the fun. How the starlings jabbered
and screamed, and what an ill-bred, ill-conditioned lot
they were, as they all talked at once, screamed, scolded—vulgar,
loud, noisy, common, and essentially of low
origin.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few of the Watch Tower pigeons swept down
with a flutter of musical wings, and were about to fall
upon the food, when crowds of jackdaws left the old
stone tiled roof and dashed in for their share, uttering
as they went their weird ghostly cry. For a
moment the noise was chaotic—the pigeons cooed and
strutted, the starlings screamed, and the jackdaws pressed
greedily forward to seize and carry off all they could get.
Suddenly there was a noise, hungry, passionate, furious,
like an angry motor pressing forward in a race and
bent on dealing death on all sides; and I saw the peacock
dash forward, his tail up, and his neck outstretched.
He fell upon the food and would allow none to partake of
any, till he had had his fill. Behind him followed his
three wives, but at a respectful distance; he was not gallant
like a barndoor cock, in fact he was much too fine
a fellow to think of any one but himself. His tail feathers
were not yet quite perfect, and they seemed swathed in
places in silver paper, but his neck was glorious, of a
brilliant blue with shimmers of golden reflections, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
of a colour that has no equal. He had a viperish head,
and was gloriously beautiful, and morally, a collection
of all the vices—greedy, spiteful, and furiously ill-tempered.
He slew, last spring, a whole clutch of young
“widdies,” as the country people call ducklings, and
killed, in a fit of anger, two of his own chicks. Burbidge
dislikes him on account of the damage he does in a
garden, but respects him for his beauty.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is like an army of ‘blows’” (blossoms), he
says, “and creates more damage than a tempest at
harvest time, does old Adam.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mouse, whilst I was watching the scene outside
through the long lancet window, seized upon her
opportunity and leapt up upon the bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish you wouldn’t,” I said feebly. “I am sure
the fire was nice enough, even for a dog.” But Mouse
thought differently; she turned round in a distracting,
disagreeable way, some three or four times, as wild dogs
are said to do in the prairies, on the bed—my bed, and
then flumped down heavily across my feet. I wriggled
uneasily, but Mouse had gained her point and had no
feelings for my discomfort; she rested upon the bed,
which to every well-constituted dog-mind is a great
achievement, almost an acknowledgment of sovereignty.
There she would lie, I knew, until some divertisement
could be suggested that would appeal to her palate, or
some suggestion of danger outside. For Mouse is greedy
and lazy, but faithful as most dogs are, and few human
beings. I dared not slap or speak rudely, for great
Danes are gifted with acute sensibilities; and if I were
to be so ill-judged as to express displeasure by an unpleasant
gesture, she would remain broken-hearted and
aggrieved for the rest of the day.</p>

<p class='c014'>Alas! for the liberty of the subject. I groaned for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
folks who indulge their dogs in caprice and greed, but I
had not the courage to fight for myself and so had to
suffer. There is really much to be urged in favour of
the fortunate people who are dog-less.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GARDEN OF EDEN</div>

<p class='c014'>I turned my head and looked with delight at my
flowers. While I gazed, my mind flew back, and away
to the land of sunshine from whence they came. I thought
of sunny Mentone with its blue sky, and glittering
groves of oranges and lemons that hung in the sunlight
like balls of fire and light; of Cap St. Martin stretching
seaward, and, above all, of the beautiful garden of La
Mortola that I visited several times when I stayed at
the Bellevue. How wonderfully exquisite that garden
was, running down to the turquoise sea, a perfect fairy-land
of delight—the old villa, once a mediæval palace, in
the centre, with its well, with its marble floors, its
cypress groves and fir pines, its sheets of brilliant
anemones, its agaves and aloes, and its cacti.</p>

<p class='c014'>It made me think of the garden of Eden before the
Fall, that garden of La Mortola—it seemed hardly a real
place, so beautiful was it; and its thirty maidens that
weeded the paths and watered the blossoms, seemed
scarcely more real.</p>

<p class='c014'>How well I remembered walking round the garden,
with the kind and courteous owner of this land of enchantment;
how he showed us all his rare and strange
plants, plants from all parts of the world, old and new.
There were many varieties of oranges and lemons, and the
air, as we walked in the golden light of a March day, was
laden with the entrancing sweetness of the Pittosporum.
But above all, what interested me most in the Enchanted
Land was the old Roman road, which runs just above
the kitchen garden, and below the flower garden. Here,
it is recorded on a tablet let into the wall, is the place
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
where Napoleon and his victorious army passed into
Italy. It is a narrow little path on which the whole of
the French army passed, with scarcely room for two
men to ride abreast. Below lay the sea like a lake, of
that wonderful delicate blue that is only to be seen in
Mediterranean waters, tideless and brilliant, and beyond
were the purple coasts of Corsica.</p>

<p class='c014'>I remembered at the end of my first visit my kind
host asking me amongst his rare and beautiful flowers,
what I had most admired? I replied, the sheets of
violets, but violets as it is impossible to imagine in
chilly England, sheets of purple, unhidden by leaves,
and gorgeous in their amethystine glory—violets growing
in great beds many yards long in the middle of the
garden, like mantles of purple. They were a glorious
vision, a sight of beauty that I shall never forget, a
revelation of colour. As I looked at the bunches that
my friend had sent, I thought of those exquisite perfumed
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterres</span></i>, of the song of the blackcaps amongst the
olives, of the golden sunlight, and of the radiant beauty
of sea and sky. Yes, the garden of La Mortola was
wonderfully, marvellously beautiful, and it even then
seemed to me doubly beautiful, seeing it as I did in my
mental vision, across sheets of snow and in the grim
atmosphere of an English winter.</p>

<p class='c014'>What a true joy beautiful memories are! the real
jewels of the soul that no robber can steal, and that no
moth or rust can corrupt, the great education of sense
and heart. Then I took my books and enjoyed a
browse. What a good thing leisure is, leisure to read
and think. Nobody interrupted me, only the chimes
of the old parish church told me the hour from time
to time.</p>

<p class='c014'>With measured cadence, drowsily and melodiously
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
they sounded across the snow-bound earth. “Time to
dream, time to dream,” they seemed to say.</p>

<p class='c014'>Later on came my luncheon, cutlets with onion chips
and jelly. Mouse got the bones. She was polite enough
to leap off the bed and to crack them on the floor—and
I was grateful for small mercies. A minute afterwards,
and I rang my hand-bell, and Célestine scurried
down.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame a froid, madame est malade,</span>” and in her
impetuous Gallic way, waited for no reply. However,
when I could make myself heard, I told her that I
meant to get up, as my friend was coming down from
the Red House to embroider with me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT CURTAINS</div>

<p class='c014'>When my toilet was completed, I begged Célestine
to bring my big basket from the chapel hall below, and
the curtain that I was engaged in embroidering for my
oratory. The background is of yellow linen and is
thickly covered with fourteenth and fifteenth century
birds, beasts, and flowers, and in the centre of each
there is an angel.</p>

<p class='c014'>Each curtain is three yards four inches, by two
yards four inches. The birds, beasts, and flowers are
all finely shaded and are worked in crewels, tapestry
wools divided, in darning and fine Berlin wools, and
all these various sorts seem to harmonize and mingle
wonderfully well together.</p>

<p class='c014'>The picture, for it really is a picture, was drawn out
for me by a very skilful draughtsman. The birds,
beasts, and angels have been taken from old Italian
work, from mediæval stained-glass windows, and from
old missals, and then drawn out to scale. There
are Tudor roses, Italian carnations, sprays of shadowy
love-in-the-mist, dusky wallflowers, and delightful half-heraldic
birds and beasts, running up and hanging down
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
the stems. It is a great work. Constance, who is good
enough to admire it, says that she is sure that the
Water-poet would have said, if he could have seen it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Flowers, plants and fishes, beasts, birds, flies and bees,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hills, dales, plains, pastures, skies, seas, rivers, trees:</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s nothing near at hand or farthest sought</div>
      <div class='line'>But with the needle may be shaped and wrought.</div>
      <div class='line'>Moreover, posies rare and anagrams,</div>
      <div class='line'>Art’s life included, within Nature’s bounds.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There are four curtains to do, and alas, I have only
one pair of hands!</p>

<p class='c014'>I keep all carefully covered up with old damask
napkins as I go along, so that neither ground nor work
can get rubbed or soiled, and embroider, myself, in what
my old housekeeper calls pie-crust sleeves, to save the
slightest friction from my dress on the yellow linen.</p>

<p class='c014'>As to the cherubim’s and seraphim’s wings, they
have been my great and constant delight. I dreamt of
a wild glory of colour which I hardly dared to realize,
but of which I found wonderful examples one sunny day
in the macaw grove at the Zoo. I went up and down and
inspected the marvellous birds for an hour, drinking in
with rapture the extraordinary richness of their plumage.
How marvellous they were! Red, blue, mauve, green,
scarlet, rose, and yellow, all pure unsullied colours, and
like flashes of light. They seemed to me like a triumphant
tune set to pealing chords. There seemed in those
glorious creatures to be no drawbacks, no shadows, no
trivialities of daily life. In their resplendent feathers
they appeared to gather light and to reproduce the
majesty of the sun itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE JOY OF COLOUR</div>

<p class='c014'>I went home, my eyes almost dazzled with their
radiancy, and a week after attempted to work into my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
curtain something of what I had seen—a feeble reflection,
I fear, but still a reflection. In my angels and
cherubim I have allowed no greys or browns, no twilight
shades. Everywhere I have introduced a pure
warm note of intense joyous colour, and if I have not
always succeeded, at least the wings of my celestial
beings have been a great source of delight to imagine,
and to execute. In my colouring it has been always
morning. Bess was charmed to run and fetch me the
different wools needed—“Summer suns,” she called
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have often noticed that to a young child, pure
brilliant colours are an intense joy and a source of
gaiety. It is only as the shades of the prison-house
draw near, and press upon us, that the lack of appreciation
creeps in for what to children and to primitive
man is a great and constant glory. That day I was
going to embroider some anemones, such as I remembered
in the old market-place of Mentone, and a sprig of
stocks, such as I recollected once having seen on a drive
to Brigg. The eye of the mind can be a great pleasure if
properly cultivated. It may not be actually correct, but
it can give the soul and the life of things remembered,
even through the mist of years.</p>

<p class='c014'>And now one word, dear sister-devotees of the
needle, about embroidery. Do not imagine that shading
in five or six shades of the same colour, which is the
way that nine people out of ten work, is the true and
natural one. This only produces a sad and wooden
flower, without life or gladness, and conceived and
worked amongst the shades of twilight. Take any
flower and place it in the sunlight, and you will see
in any purple flower, for instance, that there are not
only different shades, but different colours—red, mauve,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
blue, lavender, and violet. I realized as I gazed at
my anemone, that it must be embroidered in greyish
lavenders, with here and there pure notes of violet
with heather tints, in red purples, in greyish whites,
and with a vivid apple-green centre. All these were
strikingly different colours, but were necessary in the
shading to make my blossom look as if it had grown
amidst sunlight and shower.</p>

<p class='c014'>I stood my bunch of real flowers in water in as
strong a light as possible; as to the sunshine, alas!
of that there was but a scanty supply, and I had to
imagine that mostly, as also the scent of the orange
groves and the thrilling song of the blackcaps overhead,
for in our northern world, let it be written with
sorrow, many and long are the dull leaden months
between each summer. Still light did something,
and imagination did the rest. I imagined myself
back under the brilliant sky of southern France, and
I thought I saw the bowls of brilliant flowers as I
had known them, whilst I threaded my needle.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly Mouse slipped off the bed, and whined at
the door. I understood her anxiety to run out, for I,
too, had heard a tramp on the gravel path outside, and
had seen the keeper Gregson go off towards the back-door
laden with a string of rabbits, a plover or two,
and a brace of partridges neatly fastened to a stick,
as is the way of keepers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUSE, POUR LE SPORT</div>

<p class='c014'>The black retriever that was following Gregson is a
dear friend of Mouse’s. Once my dog went out shooting.
In the cells of her brain that day has always
remained a red letter day; I believe on this celebrated
occasion she ran in, and did all that a sporting dog
should not do, knocked down a beater who was endeavouring
to lead “the great beast,” fought a yellow
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
retriever, but did find and successfully bring back, puffing
and panting like a grampus, a wounded bird that
had escaped keepers, beaters, and trained dogs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her’s like a great colt in the plough, but her has
a beautiful nose,” Gregson always declared, “and if
so be her had been brought up proper, would have
been an ornament to her profession.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The memory of this “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jour de gloire,</span>” as Célestine
called it, had never left my canine friend, and my
gigantic watch-dog had ever since retained a devouring
passion for field sports. To humour my dog, I opened
the door, and Mouse disappeared, and swept by like a
hurricane, ponderous and terrible, down the newel
staircase heaving and whining with impatience. A
second later and I saw her below greeting Gregson
effusively.</p>

<p class='c014'>Our old keeper was pleased at her welcome. “Good
Mouse,” I heard him call. And then I heard him cry out
to our French cook, Auguste, “Mouse, she seems like
a bobby off duty when she finds me. There’s nature
in the dog for all her lives in the drawing-room, lies
on sofas and feeds on kickshaws.” Auguste agreed,
and then seeing the game, gesticulated and exclaimed,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelle chasse! C’est splendide, et vous——</span>” A
moment later I heard the door close, and Gregson disappeared
into the old Abbey kitchen to smoke, doubtless,
the pipe of peace, after partaking liberally of a certain
game pie, that we had the day before at luncheon.</p>

<p class='c014'>The voices grew faint, and I returned to my work.
I threaded several needles with different colours, pricked
them handy for use in a pincushion, and then began
to copy my flowers on the table as deftly as I could,
and awaited my friend.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was very peaceful outside. All looked grey and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
cold, the snow lay white and pure, and the only note
of colour was the glistening ivy. There was no sound,
the starlings had vanished. Far away I saw a flock
of rooks, dim specks against the leaden sky. I sat and
embroidered in silence, when suddenly the calm of the
winter afternoon was broken by the gay laughter of a
child, and I discerned my Bess, chattering below with
our old gardener Burbidge.</p>

<p class='c014'>In one hand he carried a pole, whilst Bess had
tightly clutched hold of the other. I opened my
lattice window and inquired what they were about
to do?</p>

<p class='c014'>The reply came back from Burbidge that he and
the gardeners were going to shake off the snow from the
great yew hedge by the bowling-green. “The snow
be like lead to my balls,” said the old man, “and as
to the peacock’s tail, I fear it will damage the poor
bird unless it be knocked off dang-swang”—which is
Burbidge’s Shropshire way of saying “at once.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge always speaks of the yew peacock as the
real bird, and of Adam, our blue-necked pet, as “him
that plagues us in the garden.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess laughed with joy at the thought of so congenial
an occupation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall help too,” she cried, as she waved her
hand to me, “for Ben” (the odd man) “has cut me a
stick, and I am going to knock as well as anybody.
I have done all my lessons, mamsie,” she bawled. “I
know enough for one day, and now I’m going to work,
really work.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I kissed my hand, and Bess passed off the scene
accompanied by a train of gardeners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A COUNTRY BRINGING UP</div>

<p class='c014'>Just before Bess was quite out of sight Célestine
poked out her head from a top window above, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
I heard her raise her voice to scold angrily but
ineffectually. Célestine has an unfortunate habit of
giving unasked, her advice freely. Like a cat, she has
a horror of getting wet, and has a rooted belief that
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une petite fille bien élevée</span></i> should remain in, in bad
weather, nurse her doll by the fire, or learn to make
her dolly’s clothes. I did not catch all that my maid
said, but some of her stray words of indignation reached
me. I heard that something was not <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentil</span></i>, and something
else was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">infâme</span></i>, and Bess in particular “une
petite fille impolie.” In answer to this I caught a
defiant laugh from Bess, and then Célestine banged
down her window above.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='illus-400'>
  <img src='images/illus_037.jpg' width="400" height="274" id='i037'
    alt="THE ABBEY FARMERY."/>
<p class='le-caption'><i>Photo by Frith.</i></p>
<p class='ce-caption'>THE ABBEY FARMERY.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='c014'>I sat down and worked in silence. Bess is an only
child—and will come to no harm under old Burbidge’s
care, I said to myself. In fact, she will learn under
his tutorship many of the delightful things that make
life worth having afterwards. She will so acquire the
knowledge of the things that are seen, and not learnt
by book; she will get to know the different notes of
the birds, and to distinguish their eggs. She will hear
from him the names of the hedge-row flowers, and
learn where to find the rare ones, and know by country
names all the sweet natural things that enable us to
appreciate a long walk in the country, or a turn round
our gardens. She will thus unconsciously learn to love
simple wild things, and homely pleasures, and these
will be for her stepping-stones to the higher education
in the future.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why is the society of old servants so delightful to
children? I asked myself this question, as I asked it
also of my little maid, a few weeks before, when she gave
me her definition of a happy day—a day to be spent,
if I remember rightly, in the company of Burbidge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
with Ben the odd boy, and in driving with Crawley, the
Yorkshire coachman.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should like to be swung by Ben from the old
walnut tree, to garden, and catch tadpoles with Burbidge,
and to drive the old grey mare all by myself
with Crawley.” And Bess added: “Then, mamsie, I
should be quite happy; and mummie, do let it come
true on my first holiday, or on my next birthday.” “If
there could be no ‘don’ts,’” another time Bess told me,
“I should be always good; and if I had no nurse, or
governess, I should never be naughty.” I try to implant
in Bess’s mind that nurse and governess are her duties
in life. She agrees but sadly, and like most modern
people, poor child, wishes to get rid of life’s duties as
quickly as possible. “I never mean to be naughty,”
Bess asserts, “but naughtiness comes to me like spoiling
a frock, when I least expect it.” And she once
added, “I know, mummy, if people didn’t think me
naughty I never should be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I pondered over these nursery problems as the
work grew under my hands. How delicate and exquisite
were all the shades of grey and lavender in the
real flowers. I inspected my threaded needles, but I
could not find amongst my crewels the necessary tints.
I took a thread of tapestry wool, divided it carefully,
and then turning to a box of Scotch fingering on cards,
found exactly what was needed, a warm shade of
heather. Embroidery is so much to me. It is part
of my life, and flowers and birds when done recall
thoughts and joys and pains, as scents are said to bring
back the past to most people. A story is told of a
French lady who, when they told her that her daughter-in-law
did not like needlework, replied, “She is very
young—she has never known real sorrow.”</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PLAYMATE FOR BESS</div>

<p class='c014'>All of a sudden I dropped my work and started up,
for all the dogs had begun to bark in chorus. I ran to
the window. I heard the crunch of the gravel, and a
minute later I saw a carriage drawn by a pair of greys
stop before our old front door.</p>

<p class='c014'>Out of the brougham there emerged the little figure
of Harry, Colonel Stanley’s only little boy and Bess’s
playmate. He was accompanied by his German governess,
a fat, phlegmatic personage, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein Schliemann</span>
by name. As she got out, I heard her say, “I have one
letter to leave, most important,” and she stood waiting
on the doorstep for Fremantle to show her into the
house. In the selfsame moment, Harry, hearing voices
in the rose garden, without a word, and nimble as a
rabbit, darted through the wrought-iron gates and
waved his hand to Bess. In a second Bess appeared,
a shower of snow upon her cap and amongst her locks,
but redolent of health, and full of gaiety. “Is that you,
Hals?” she cried, and the children dashed off to the
end of the garden together.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> in the mean time discoursed with Fremantle
and gave up her letter. All this I noticed from my
room. Through my window I heard peals of laughter,
and I saw Hals on the back of an under-gardener, pursued
by Bess, who was engaged in throwing handfuls of
snow at him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Happily this spectacle was not witnessed by <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein
Schliemann</span>, for water and snow are always repellent
to her, and incomprehensible as sources of pleasure or
amusement. She heaved a big sigh and then, preceded
by the butler, went into the old chapel hall and plumped
her fat self down on an old oak chair. A quick knock
at my door, and Fremantle brought me the letter. The
note contained an invitation for Bess to go over and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
spend the following Saturday afternoon at Hawkmoor,
Colonel Stanley’s country house, some six miles away.
It would be little Harry’s birthday, I was told, and the
diversions and amusements in his honour, were to be
great, and varied.</p>

<p class='c014'>Punch and Judy in the front hall, a conjuror, a
magic-lantern, and later on a birthday cake, with
lighted candles, as many as the years that little Hals
(as Bess calls him) would have attained to.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do,” wrote my cousin, Venetia Stanley, “let little
Bess be at Harry’s eighth birthday. I often feel my
little lad is very lonely, and Bess’s presence would make
his birthday a double joy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In a moment I had scribbled back an answer. Of
course Bess must go, I wrote. Harry was a dear little
boy, and being entertained and the art of entertaining
are parts of the higher and necessary education of
children. I carried down my note myself, and assured
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> of my delight in accepting so charming an
invitation for my little girl.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> simpered, and I called for tea. At the
Abbey there are no bells on the ground floor. Then I
remembered the children, and turned to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> and
asked her if she knew where they were.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Heinrich is with Bess,” I was told. About a
quarter of an hour later, when a hissing urn was
brought in, I begged Fremantle to ring my hand-bell, as
a signal to the loiterers that tea was ready.</p>

<p class='c014'>For some time this summons received no answer,
but at last, breathless but blissful, the children appeared.
But in what a plight! Heinrich’s deep red
velvet suit was soaked and sadly soiled, and his cap and
long flaxen curls dripped with moisture, whilst Bess’s
garments were running with mud and wet, and as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
both stood in the chapel hall, little pools of water guttered
down beside them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRÄULEIN IS FURIOUS</div>

<p class='c014'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> started up and screamed hysterically, and
I darted forward. “My dears, how wet you are,” I
cried. “You must go and change at once.” And
without another word I hurried off both children to the
nursery. It was an easy matter to put Bess into a fresh
dry frock and into a clean white pinafore, but what
could be done with Harry? I asked myself. He is a
delicate child, and must not remain in damp clothes, so
I turned to him resolutely, and asked, “Which will you
do, Harry: get into one of Bess’ dresses, or go to bed?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, auntie,” he answered, blushing furiously, for
he always calls me “auntie,” although I am not his
real aunt, “I would much rather go to bed than wear a
girl’s dress.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So we were about to put him into bed when a sudden
brilliant idea flashed through my brain. “My husband’s
dressing-gown,” I murmured. In a moment, kindly
Fremantle, who heard me, had fetched it. It was yards
too long, but it was turned up with an army of safety-pins,
and so Hals’ vanity was not humiliated. At least
he was clothed in male attire! And we must always
remember that self-respect in a little lad is even more
easily wounded than love.</p>

<p class='c014'>Five minutes later both children were dry, and clad
in other costumes. “I don’t think that they will be any
the worse,” I said to my old nurse, Milner. But as I
entered the chapel hall I noticed that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> looked
as black as thunder. In her eyes the episode was a
most disagreeable, even a disgraceful occurrence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hals paused on the threshold for a moment and
looked at me beseechingly out of his pretty, round,
short-sighted eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
“I am so sorry,” I said apologetically, and felt really
for a second a transitory shame, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> looked so
fierce and injured. “How did it happen?” I asked of
Bess, by way of lifting the leaden pall of silence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Only a rat hunt,” answered that young lady,
jauntily, with her mouth full of buttered toast, for she
had not waited for grace, but had slipped into her seat
at the head of the tea-table. “There was a rat,” she
continued to explain, “in the potting-shed, and Trump
and Tartar smelt him out and ran after him, and Hals
joined in and tumbled over. He shouldn’t wear smart
clothes when he comes here. Nobody wants him to.
Gregson says, ‘By gum, give me the varminty sort,’”
and Bess laughed rather rudely, after which there was
an awkward and prolonged pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hals is your guest,” at last I said severely; upon
which Bess turned scarlet, and a second later plied Hals
with seed and sponge cake at once.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had the velvet suit taken to the kitchen fire to dry,
but I must honestly confess that its magnificence was, I
feared, a thing of the past. While we sat on, Fremantle
entered, and in his most irreproachable voice informed
us that Mrs. Langdale (the housekeeper) was of opinion
that Master Harry’s suit would not be fit for him to
wear again that day. At this <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> wrung her hands
and broke out into ejaculations. “Mein Gott! mein
Gott!” she cried, and began to scold Harry furiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>At this, Bess could keep down her wrath no longer.
With flashing eyes she confronted Hals’ governess. “It
was my fault, all my fault,” she said. “I told Hals to
run like mad, and not to miss the fun.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> did not deign to answer Bess’ justification
of her pupil, but glared at Hals; and we all remained
on in silence, and I noted that poor little Hals had a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
white face, and that both slices of cake on his plate
remained untouched.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRIENDSHIP’S OFFER</div>

<p class='c014'>“I will write and explain all to Mrs. Stanley,” I said
at last; “only,” and here I turned to Harry, “you must
go back in the dressing-gown, dear, and be wrapped up
warmly in a rug. No colds must be caught, and the
suit shall be sent back to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hals nodded his head. Whatever happened he was
not going to cry; only girls and muffs cried, but he knew
that there was a bad time coming, when he would have
to face the music.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess watched his face. She was up in arms.
Directly after grace was said, and this time by her in
a jiffy, she flung herself off her chair, flew upstairs
defiant, and breathless. A minute later she reappeared,
her face crimson, but her mouth set.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How much?” she asked of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>, in a hostile
spirit. “How much? I say, if I <em>pay</em>, you mayn’t
punish.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But here Hals dashed forward, and would not let Bess
put her purse into his governess’s hand. “Don’t,”
he said; “boys can’t take money from girls.” And
Bess was left stammering and confused, with her own
sky-blue purse left in her little fat paw. I pretended
not to see what had happened as I sat down and
wrote a note to my friend, Venetia Stanley, to explain
all, and to beg forgiveness for the little culprit. I pleaded
that tumbles, like accidents, would happen in the best
regulated nurseries. I addressed my letter, and stuck
down the envelope. This done, we all sat on in sombre
silence round the fire. All conversation died upon our
lips, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> looked so sour and forbidding.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last our gloomy interview was broken up by
Fremantle entering the room and announcing the fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
that Colonel Stanley’s carriage was at the door, and a
message from the coachman to the effect that he hoped
the greys would not be kept waiting.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then without more ado, Fremantle lifted Hals in his
arms, for the dressing-gown was too long to permit the
little boy to walk, and Tom, the footman, followed with
a thick fur rug to wrap round him. “Give Master Hals
my note,” I called, as the little party vanished through
the outside door.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> went last, an evil glare on her fat face, and
“as dark as tempest,” Burbidge would have said if he
had seen her, and I noted that she would not take my
hand at parting. She evidently thought the disaster
that had befallen the red suit was due to me. I was
<i>wae</i> for the little man, as he vanished from my sight;
that stupid German woman had no more sympathy with
the young life that throbbed and beat in him, than if
she were a table or a chair, and he would certainly have
what the French call a bad quarter of an hour with her
before she had done.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess stood for a minute or two after they were gone,
and we looked blankly at each other. Bess cried,
“Beast, beast!” and then burst into floods of tears.
“She will punish him,” she moaned, “she will punish
him,” and she buried her face amongst the sofa cushions
of the great settee.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first I felt powerless to soothe her, or to induce
her to take a less gloomy view of the situation. “It
is unfair and mean of the old <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>,” she kept on
calling out, “for I did offer to pay on the nail” (Bess has
acquired a considerable amount of slang); “and I offered
her all the money I had. Five shillings that came at
Christmas, half a crown from Uncle St. John, and sixpence
which I won in good marks from Miss Weldon.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
Bess was of opinion that so magnificent a sum was
enough for a king’s ransom, and ought to have bought
all, or any attires, and to have silenced all voices of
reproof.</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not undeceive my little maid. After all, it
was all her earthly wealth, and all that she possessed
she had offered to save her little friend from punishment.
Later on darkness fell, Fremantle appeared with
a lamp, and Bess fetched her work, a kettle on a
vermilion ground of cross-stitch, which I have often
been told “will be so useful to papa on his birthday;”
and I started reading aloud, for Bess’s edification, one
of Hans Andersen’s beautiful stories.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“BETTER THAN TRUE”</div>

<p class='c014'>As I closed the book, Bess exclaimed, “It is not
true, but it is better than true—beautiful stories
always are—and there, at least, is no horrid German
governess. If I chose,” my little girl said, “I should only
have a Yorkshire, or a Shropshire governess. Burbidge
says there’s many wise folks as cannot understand
foreigners; and Crawley says, ‘Give me plain Yorkshire,
and I’ll knock sense into any one’s head.’” Then
we discussed the story. I had read the tale of the
Ugly Duckling, perhaps the most beautiful story of all
fairy-land. Bess listened open-mouthed, and her eyes
glistened like stars with joy at the end. “I shall
always think a swan is a fairy prince,” she murmured.
“Why don’t beautiful things happen much oftener?
Only lessons, nursery tea, stains, and mistakes come every
day.” As she spoke, the old church clock struck seven,
and Bess put away her work in a little crimson bag.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat before the great open fireplace and listened
to my little girl’s talk. Through the latticed windows
of the oratory shone a soft mist of stars.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sometimes beautiful things really happen,” I said;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
and then through the open door I saw old Nana standing.
A hurried kiss from Bess, and the child was
gone.</p>

<p class='c014'>Later on, in the evening, after dinner, I mounted the
old newel staircase and made my way to the old nursery
up in the roof with its latticed dormer windows. There,
to my surprise, I found Bess wide awake.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have told Miss Bess not to talk no more,” said
Nana, rather sourly; “but she will run on about Master
Harry and his German punishments.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My old body’s sympathy for once was with <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>,
for spoiling a vest and a velvet suit can never be otherwise
than a crime in any nurse’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went and sat by my little maid’s white dimity
hung cot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think he will be forgiven,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“P’raps he’ll turn into a fairy prince,” said Bess,
and she took my hand, “and then it will all come right.”
In a few moments I saw that she was getting drowsy,
for she looked at me with half-closed eyes—one eye
tinnin’ and the other carrin’ trout, as Shropshire folks
say when you are overcome with sleep. Then Bess
went on in the sing-song voice that so often immediately
precedes sleep with children, “Hals was an ugly duck
to-day, but he’ll turn into a swan or something nice
some day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Some day,” I nodded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, when Hals’ birthday comes.” And Bess’s eyes
closed gently, and she slipped away into the blessed land
of dreams.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I went downstairs I found a letter from my
friend Constance of the Red House, to tell me that at the
last moment she was detained by a visit from a poor old
body whose son was ill, and so couldn’t come down to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
tea; but that she trusted on the morrow to find me, what
Bess calls, “quite better.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">BILLY FIRE-DEW COMES</div>

<p class='c014'>The following day fresh snow fell. All nature lay
covered up with what Burbidge calls “a fine hoodin’.”
Before my eyes a pure white dazzling plain of snow
extended, and even the old stone roof and the ruined
church glistened white and wonderful. As soon as I was
called, I opened my window and saw my tame robin, who
one summer was hatched in a yew hedge, appear on my
window-sill. Billy Fire-Dew, Bess has christened him,
and Billy Buttons he is known as, by Burbidge and the
gardeners. He has a brilliant flame-coloured breast, soft
rich brown wings, and large round liquid eyes. For a
minute he rested upon the window, then with a joyous
chirp he spread his wings and hopped upon a great
Spanish chestnut sixteenth-century chest, which stands
in the centre of my bedroom. On the chest are figures
of gods and goddesses, burnt in by an iron.</p>

<p class='c014'>Happily I was not unprovided with suitable refreshment
to offer my little guest. A scrap of sponge cake
in a wine glass, saved from last night’s dinner, met with
his entire approval. It had been intended for Mouse,
but as at the last moment she could not be found, so Bill
was in luck. I sprinkled some crumbs about the chest,
and on my writing-table, and he hopped about puffing
himself out, quite unabashed, and partook freely of the
breakfast I offered him. I did not move as I watched
him, but remained standing stock-still. I have always
found one of the great secrets of bird taming is to keep
immovable, till all sense of fear is lost by constant
familiarity.</p>

<p class='c014'>How beautiful he was, with his great hazel eyes, and
his scarlet waistcoat beneath his sober hood.</p>

<p class='c014'>He chirped loudly as he ate, and then flew joyfully
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
from table to bed, and from bed to table, and so at last
back to the window-sill, uttering at moments his clear
bell-like cry. Whilst I was engaged in watching my
little feathered friend, I heard the click of the latch of
my door, and Bess entered bearing in her arms the
nursery cat Grey Smokey.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, beware!” I cried alarmed. “Billy Fire-Dew is
here.” In an instant Bess had opened the door again
and evicted her favourite, but not without noise; and
Bill had caught fright, and with a loud shrill cry, had
flown into the garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, outside the door, Smokey began to mew
piteously. “Let her in,” I said, “she can do no harm
now. Bill is quite safe.” So the puss entered, and
although habitually the gentlest of creatures, I saw
that the instinct of an animal of prey was strong within
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>For Smokey paced up and down my room; her eyes
shone like topazes in the sunlight, and as she walked,
she lashed her tail like a lioness at the Zoo.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She’d kill poor Bill if she could get him,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” answered Bess, “and eat him up, without
pepper and salt. Cats are never really kind, not right
through, for all their purring.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Bess asked me what I meant to do, now that I
was well again. “Papa,” she said, “told me that I might
go sledging some day; but this morning you must take
me and show me where St. Milburgha was buried, and tell
me also about the old monks. Do you know, mama,
I often think of the monks in bed. Last night—I
don’t remember all, but there was something that happened
with a man in a black gown, and Hals did something
as a swan—I rather disremember,” continued my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
little maid, with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>, “for I fell asleep before I could
rightly recollect. But Burbidge perhaps will tell me;
he knows a lot about monks. It is fine, as Nana says,
to be such a scholard.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah! now I remember,” said Bess, after a pause.
“Burbidge declares that they walled up Christians, the
monks, and drank out of golden cups, and hunted the
deer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was amused at Burbidge’s views—they were
obviously those of the very primitive Protestant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come into the garden this morning, child, and I
will tell you a little about the monks.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A few hours later I called “Bess!” from the gravel
below. “Are you ready?” Then I heard a buzz of
excited voices from the nursery, and a great fight, going
on over the winding round of a comforter, and Bess leapt
down two stairs at a time and joined me in the
garden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WALK IN THE CLOISTERS</div>

<p class='c014'>I had my snowshoes on, so I had no sense of cold,
and round my shoulders heavy furs. Mouse sported
before us rather like a benevolent luggage train, whilst
the two terriers, Tramp and Tartar, cut capers, barked,
and sniffed and frisked. These hunted in the bushes,
darted in and out, and sought for rabbits under every
stone and tree. They yelped and put their noses
frantically into holes and corners. Whether the rabbits
were real or imaginary it was impossible to say.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bright sunshine fell upon the old red sandstone of
which the later part of the old Abbey Farmery is built,
and cast an opalescent glare on the snow-covered roof.
The old yew hedges stood forth like banks of verdant
statuary, in places where the snow had melted, and on
the top of a stone ball stood the blue-necked peacock.</p>

<p class='c014'>The day was deliciously crisp, clear, and invigorating,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
and Bess, as she ran along, laughed and snowballed me
and the dogs, and so we wandered away into the cloisters.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell me about it all,” said Bess at last, confidentially,
after a time of breathless frolicking with the dogs.
“Miss Weldon talks so much that I can never understand
her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I told Bess in a few simple words about the
cloisters. “There was, first of all, dear,” I said, “a
party of Saxon ladies who lived at the abbey, and the
most beautiful was Milburgha, their abbess. She came
here to avoid a wicked Welsh prince, and she rode a
beautiful milk-white steed. And she was very holy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should be holy, if I rode a milk-white steed,” said
Bess, impulsively, “I am sure I should.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And then I added rather irrelevantly, “St. Milburgha
kept geese.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Saints and princesses always do,” answered Bess,
authoritatively. “I know what they did, they combed
their hair with golden combs, and talked to emperors in
back gardens. Then they always had flocks of goats or
geese. I don’t think they could get on without that,
mama,” said my little maid, with a gasp. “It must be
very amusing,” she continued, “to be a saint or a princess
and have a crown. They have them in Bible picture-books.
Anyway, they never have any lessons or governesses,
hardly mamas, and they only talk to the animals.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='le-caption'><i>Photo by Frith.</i></p>
<p class='ce-caption'>THE CLOISTER GARDEN.</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>“But, my little girl,” I urged, “saints have to be
<em>very</em> good; and then you must remember, Bess, that
princesses in all the stories have to accomplish terrible
tasks, and saints to endure terrible pains.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Worse,” asked Bess, “than taking horrible, nasty,
filthy medicines, worse than going to have teeth taken
out by the dentist?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Worse than that,” I answered.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CROWN OF MARTYRDOM</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then I think I’ll wait a little,” replied Bess, with
composure, “before I change; for I should not like a
crown after losing my teeth, or worse, or even jam-rolly,
if I had to take tumblers of horrid physic first. And I
have heard Burbidge say that, ‘them as wins a crown
must walk on hot ploughshares first.’ Still,” she added,
“I should sometimes like to be good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How about doing disagreeable things, Bess? For I
fear, at first, that is what has to be done.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, mama,” answered Bess, “not too good; not
good enough to die, but just good enough to get a little
more money for good marks than I have ever got
before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And I saw by Bess’s saucy smile that the day was
a long, long way off when she would ever be what she
calls very, very good, <i>i.e.</i>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Never dirty her hands;</div>
      <div class='line'>Never ruffle her hair; and</div>
      <div class='line'>Never answer back those in authority.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>For a moment we ceased talking, and looked at the
old carved stone basin in which the successors of Roger
de Montgomery’s Clugniac monks bathed in the twelfth
century. On the broken shaft which supported the basin
are three carved panels; one represents the miraculous
draught of fishes and the other two St. Paul and St. Peter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess shook her head and repeated sadly, “Of course
I should like to be a saint, but there must not be too
much pain. It isn’t fair of God to want <em>too much</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we wandered round to the east side of the old
house, and I looked up and pointed out to Bess the old
stone gargoyles. And Bess looked too.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Those,” she said, “are Christian devils. Nana says
we never could get on here without a Devil, and the
monks had theirs too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
There are many times in life, I find, when it is
wiser not to answer a child, and this was just one.
Strong light often dazzles, and, after all, are we not all
children groping in the dark?</p>

<p class='c014'>We peeped into the kitchen from outside, and saw
the coppers glimmering like red gold on the shelves of
the old oak dresser. Auguste, the cook, was chopping
some meat, and the blows he gave resounded
merrily through the crisp frosty air. I called through
the mullion window and asked if the little soiled suit
of yesterday was dry, as Fred the groom was to ride
over to Hawkmoor and take it there in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oui, madame la comtesse,” cried Auguste, for by
that title he always addressed me; not that I have
a title, but that Auguste thinks it kind and polite so
to address me. Besides, he has a confused belief that
every English woman has a title of some kind, and
that its exact nature is immaterial. As he spoke he
opened the little oak door that communicates with the
garden and exclaimed joyously—</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUGUSTE’S SECRET</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyez, madame, le jeune comte</span> will still be a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">joli
garçon</span> in it. See, he will still rejoice the heart of his
father and mother in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grenat foncé</span>.” So saying good-natured
Auguste passed into the garden displaying in
his arms the red suit. A miracle seemed to have been
performed. There it was, spotless and dry, and as
good as it was when made by Messrs. Tags and Buttons
of New Bond Street. Auguste laughed and talked
excitedly, gesticulated wildly, and assured me that he
had saved the costume by un secret—mais un secret
suprême known alone to him and to his family. “See,
madame,” he cried superbly, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le bon Dieu ne pourrait
pas mieux faire.</span>” Then he told me in confidence that
it was not in vain that his mother had been over thirty
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
years gouvernante in the household of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame la
Princesse de P——</span>. She knew everything, he asserted,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais tous les secrets de ménage.</span>”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed my head, and happily had the tact not to
press for an explanation, for I knew Auguste’s recipes
were real secrets, and as jealously guarded as those of
any War Office in Europe.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess clapped her hands. “Hals will be pleased,”
she said. “Because now old <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> need not be
cross, and there will be no punishments.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Auguste bowed solemnly. “Madame is satisfied,”
he said, and retired like a beneficent fairy god-mother
into the depth of his culinary kingdom.</p>

<p class='c014'>The difference between our people and the Latin
races is great. I have often noticed that Frenchmen
or Italians are delighted to know any housewifely
trick or wile—and that ignorance of all other departments
but their own does not, in their eyes, constitute
intrinsic merit. Foreigners seldom say, “That was
not my business, sir,” or “not my department.”
Whereas, in every well-constituted English domestic
mind, “not my business,” or “not my work” is a
creed to be cherished firmly, whatever else dissolves
or changes, and is treated as the bulwark of English
domestic life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Before I left the kitchen door I asked for a saucer
of chopped egg, a slice of sponge cake, a roast potato,
and half an apple for the inhabitants of my aviary.
Tramp and Tartar started barking furiously, in a noisy
inconsequent way; and off Bess and I went armed
with dainties. Mouse followed gravely, but not without
misgivings, for she took no interest in birds, and felt,
I am sure, that they enjoyed far too much consideration
from me. Bess and I descended the steps which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
led down from the garden to the field, but held on
tightly to the rails, for it was slippery.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mummie,” cried out Bess, “mind, for it is slippery
all over, like walking over a glass door.” However,
we neither of us fell, and reached the aviary door in
safety. Then we saw rather a wonderful sight: some
forty canaries of all colours—green, cinnamon, jonquil,
clear and mealy, yellow, spotted and flaked, were all
to be found there. Poor little dears! They were
making the most of the wintry gleams of sunshine,
and some of them looked rather hunched up and
puffy from the cold. They have a thatched shed, and
in front, facing due south, a long flight of some
twenty feet for exercise, beneath fine wire netting. But
their playground was cold, as Bess said. As we entered
the cage, they flew round us with cries of joy. Canaries
are very easily tamed, and they perched on the saucer
containing the food. They ate greedily the chopped
egg, and pecked at the sponge cake and apple. Bess
ran into their “bedroom” as she calls it, and squeezed
on “their dressing table” the “heart” of a big potato
cooked “in his jacket.” One cock was singing sweetly.
Burbidge must have given them water only a few
minutes before, for it was still tepid in the dish, and
some were drinking with avidity. We dropped a few
drops of sherry into the water to act as a cordial,
from a flask that Burbidge had got stowed away in a
little box of what he calls “extras,” and I added a
couple of rusty nails from the same store. I noted
that my dear old cock canary, “Bourton Boy,” that I
have had some ten years and known from an egg, looked
a little mopish—what Bess calls “fat and fluffy.” I
watched him in silence, and tried to discover what it
was he lacked. There was an ample supply of egg, apple,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
and of potato, not to speak of canary, rape, and hemp
seed, but he fluttered round and at last pecked violently
at a crystal button on my coat; then I knew what
he was after, and called out “sugar.” Bess echoed the
cry, and darted off like a little fairy for some, finely
pounded, in a scrap of paper from kind Auguste, who
adores “toutes les bêtes de madame.” We had discovered
rightly what it was that the Bourton Boy was
in need of. He uttered a note of joy, and fell upon the
sugar with a right good will directly we had placed it
in the cage, whilst Bess watched him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOURTON BOY’S REQUEST</div>

<p class='c014'>“Why don’t you give him lettuce, too? Auguste
offered me some salad,” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not good for canaries till the spring,” I replied.
Then I went to the end of the shed to see if there
was plenty of fat bacon hanging up—the birds’ cod liver
oil, as old Nana calls it. I inspected a piece some
three inches long and two wide. It was pecked all
over by voracious little beaks, and was quite thin in
places. Fat bacon is an excellent adjunct to an aviary,
and is one of the best means of keeping birds in health,
and of special value to hens during the nesting season.
In winter, also, it seems to be very nourishing, and to
give great gloss and lustre to their plumage. After
seeing that their larder was well supplied, I turned to
their baking-tin, full of red sand and very fine oyster
grit. It is really astonishing, what an amount of grit
all birds require to keep them in health. I poked up
the contents of the tin with my walking-stick. It was
amusing to watch the birds. In a moment all had
left the seed, egg, or potato, and were engaged in picking
up the freshly turned sand. A few months ago I was
obliged to have the floor of the aviary firmly cemented
down, as otherwise I found that mice burrowed from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
underneath and effected an entrance, and then attacked
my pets. The cement in a few days hardened, and
now is like a rock, and I am glad to say inroads from
the furry little barbarians have become impossible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My children of light,” as I call them, having
been visited, I turned away and escaped with Bess out
of the aviary, but not without great care, and having
resource to some stratagems, for my little feathered
friends all followed me closely, curious, and always
hoping for fresh delights. At a given signal, Bess
slipped under my arm, and we closed the door like
lightning behind us.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we mounted the stairs, we saw the old gardener
Burbidge waiting for us at the top. He looked like
a picture of Old Time, with his grey hair, his worn
brown overcoat, his long grey beard, and behind all,
the background of snow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are all well,” I called out to him, “in spite
of the cold.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They was matted up yesterday,” answered the old
man, pointing downwards to my pets. Then he went on
to say how he and the gardeners strengthened the artificial
hedge on the east side, by adding fir branches and some
mats, “for it was fit to blow their feathers out, that
mortal sharp was the eastwinder;” and Burbidge looked
at my pets with indulgent pity, and added, “They be
nesh folks, be canaries, for all they write about them.”
Then he suspected Bess of giving them forbidden food.
“They mustn’t have no green food. It be as bad for
’em as spring showers be for sucking gulleys” (goslings),
he added, “and that be certain death.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I haven’t given them anything not allowed,”
stammered out Bess, indignantly; “mama and I have
only given them what we always do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
“Ah!” said Burbidge, softening, “that won’t be
no hurt then; and as to potato and apple, they be the
best quill revivers out, come winter. But what sort of
apple was it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I replied that the apple was a “Blenheim Orange”
and no American.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“NO NEED OF FOREIGN STUFF”</div>

<p class='c014'>“No need of foreign stuff in Shropshire,” answered
Burbidge, proudly. “Our late apples are as sound as
if they were only fruited yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I told him that the potato was one of the
same sort that I had last night at dinner—floury,
sweet and mealy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I’ll be bound,” he replied, “you had an
Up-to-Dater, or may be a Sutton’s Abundance; they be
both sound as a sovereign, real gold all through. No
blotches or specks in they. We had four roods of both
on the farm. Fresh land, no manure and a dusty summer,
and tatters will take care of theirselves; but come a wet
year, a field potato is worth two in a garden, although I
says it as shouldn’t, but truth is truth, although you
have to look up a black chimney to find it, as folks say.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then old Burbidge went on to tell me how “Potatoes
be right house wenches in a garden, or same as
clouts to floors; but don’t you go to takin’ ’em from
their nature too early, for when the tops bleed the
tubers will never be fit for squire’s food, only fit for a
petty tradesman’s table,” and this with Burbidge is
always a dark, and outer land of disgrace.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess, Burbidge and I paced along the neat swept
paths. At last I got my word in. “No damage done
by the snow?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t allow no damage,” was our old retainer’s
stern reply; “leastways, not after daylight. I and lads
were out again with poles this morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
We wandered round the close-clipped yews, and
peeped over into the borders beyond, while Burbidge
talked of “how all had been put to bed” with pride.
“Them as wants next year must mind this,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c014'>All my tea-roses, Chinese peonies, and tender plants
had been duly covered up with fern; and branches of
spruce and Austrian fir had been carefully placed in front
of my clematises Flammula, Montana, and Jackmanni,
and round the posts on which my Crimson Rambler,
jessamine, and vine ramped in summer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are just resting comfortable,” said Burbidge,
complacently. “We all want sleep—plants and men—but
let the plants have it suitable, same as childer in
their beds.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We had come to the end of the red-walled garden,
and as he said this, Burbidge opened the wrought-iron
gate, and I passed down the flight of stairs which leads
to the front drive.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To-morrow we must talk about the list of flowers,”
I cried, before he was out of sight and hearing; “we
must not forget the butter-beans, and the foreign golden
lettuces.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge nodded, but not enthusiastically. He
doesn’t what he calls “hold to foreign things.” England
is his country, and, above all, Shropshire his county,
but being very faithful, he is indulgent to my foibles.
As Bess and I walked along the pathway, we lingered in
the cloisters, and for a moment looked away at the far
distance.</p>

<p class='c014'>We saw nothing but white fields which lay glittering
in the sunshine, and the spire of the parish church to
the west, which shone like a lance under the clear sky.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Some day,” Bess said, “take me right away,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
mamsie, far away with the dogs,” and she pointed to
the snow-clad meadows that stretched round the old
Abbey precincts. “I like fields,” she added, “better than
gardens to walk in, for there are no ‘don’ts’ there for the
dogs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RUINED HEDGE</div>

<p class='c014'>This remark from Bess alluded to my dislike of
broken hedges, for, as Burbidge says, “A yew hedge
broken, is a kingdom ruined.” I remember this scathing
remark was made on a terrible occasion when the great
Mouse dashed through a yew hedge in hot pursuit of
a very young rabbit, and indeed training down and
replacing the broken limb of the yew was no slight
matter. It was, in Burbidge’s phraseology, “a long and
break-back job, bad as sorting sheep on the Long-Mynd
in a snow-storm;” for, as our old gardener expressed
it, “Nature be often full of quirks, and sometimes
disobliging as a maiden aunt that’s got long in the
tooth, and that walks snip-snappy, with an empty
purse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Ever since this mishap my great hound’s sporting
habits have been, therefore, somewhat restricted in the
Pleasaunce. But if things have gone wrong by evil
chance, and large, very large, paw-marks can be detected
on the beds, Burbidge is not without his passing sarcasm.
“I prefer a bullock,” or “Big dogs be made for kennels,”
he will say. I recalled these reminiscences of spring
and summer days, but felt sure, for all he said, that
Burbidge would never hurt a hair of my dog’s tail.
Gradually the sunlight failed, and Bess and I went
indoors. I found my friend Constance, of the Red
House, awaiting my return.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her eye fell on my garden catalogues. “One wants
in life many good ways of using common things,” she
said; “a variety in fact, without the expense of change.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
And then Constance agreed with me that vegetables in
England were often only a waste material. “Many of
us,” I held, “only know sodden potatoes and cabbage,
or salad with an abominable, heavy cream sauce that
reminds one of a furniture polish.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Vegetables our side of the Channel,” laughed
Constance, “are a serious difficulty, partly on account
of the cook, and partly on account of the gardener.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We agreed that the gardener would hardly ever pick
them young or tender enough, and that this applies to
beans, carrots, peas and artichokes. This set me thinking,
and I mentioned a visit I once paid to Chartres
some years ago. It was in early June, and I saw
several waiters all shelling peas in the courtyard of the
principal hotel. I was surprised to note that each man
had three little baskets in front of him into which he
threw his peas. I was astonished to see so many little
baskets, and asked why all the peas could not be put
into one basket. “Oh, madame,” said the man in
authority, “at Chartres we acknowledge three qualities
of peas, and then there are the pods, for the pea-soup.”
In what English household would it be possible to get
the same amount of trouble taken?</p>

<p class='c014'>“The methods adopted in England are different,”
said Constance dryly. “As regards peas—generally
the gardener leaves them till they have attained the
hardness of bullets, and then the cook cooks them solely
with water, and so a very good vegetable is made as
nasty as it is possible to make it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we both came to the conclusion that peas, “as
a fine art,” should be picked very young, or else they were
very unwholesome, and that they should have mixed
with them a little gravy, cream, or fresh butter. After
this Constance asked me about my butter-beans, which,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
she told me, she thought excellent one day when she
lunched with us last September. I told her that the
variety that I grew chiefly was Wax Flageolet, and that
my seed came from the foreign seedsman, Oskar Knopff,
but that now all sorts of butter-beans can be got from
English nurserymen, and that Messrs. Barr and Veitch
have those and many other excellent sorts.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are also as easy to grow, Burbidge says, as
the old-fashioned French kinds,” I remarked, “but more
juicy and mellow, although they do not look quite so nice
on the table. Auguste likes to give them a few minutes
longer in boiling, and invariably adds, as is the French
and Italian habit, some haricot beans of last year of the
old scarlet runner sort boiled quite soft.” Then I praised
the foreign habit of serving all vegetables in cream, oil,
or a little gravy, and added it is setting the vegetable
picture in a good frame. Then from beans we turned to
potatoes, and we discussed the best kinds to grow in a
moderate-sized garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>From vegetables we wandered off to embroidery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A “WROUGHT SHEET” PLANNED</div>

<p class='c014'>“I want,” Constance told me, “to design a quilt for a
big ‘four-poster.’ What they would in the seventeenth
century have called a ‘great wrought sheet.’ I am thinking
of doing,” she said, “a great border of old-world
flowers all round my ‘bed-spread,’ as it is now called
in the art shops.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What more enchanting,” I cried enthusiastically,
and recalled to her mind the beautiful woodcuts that
illustrate “Gerard’s Herbal.” “There are there, all
the flowers and herbs,” I said, “that you could possibly
wish for, and they are all exquisitely drawn and well
adapted for such a purpose. The Great Holland, the
single Velvet, the Cinnamon, the Provence and the
Damask roses, the very names are full of poetry; then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
of wild flowers, you must think of the Wolfe’s Bane, the
Mede Safron, Ladies’ Smock, and Golden Mousear. In
the garden, there is the Guinny Hen, and, above all,
the gilly-flowers of sorts, and May pinks; and round
you might work scrolls of words from poets and philosophers
about the joys of sleep.” Then we talked the
matter over, and I got quite keen about the colour
of the background, and suggested a particular tint of
jonquil canary. But Constance would not hear of
this, declared she preferred white, and meant to use
the hand-made “homespun,” as Shropshire folks call
the sheets of the country that were made formerly at
Westwood and round Wenlock up to the second half
of the last century. “I bought,” she told me, “several
old pairs of large hand-made linen sheets at a sale two
years ago, and I feel sure they will be delightful to
work on. They are not unlike the Langdale linen,
only not so fine.” Then Constance went on to say
how, in the eighteenth century, every farmhouse in
Shropshire had its spinning wheels, and every cottager
her love spinning, when her neighbours would come
and spin with her out of love and good-fellowship.
Besides the good wife’s spinning, many a maiden’s
wedding garments were thus made for her by her own
playmates, while it was with her own hands that the
lass’s wedding sheets were always spun.</p>

<p class='c014'>Was it a better world, I have often asked myself,
when women loved their spinning-wheels and tambour-frames?</p>

<p class='c014'>Anyway it was a simpler world we both agreed,
and probably a more contented one, for all ladies
then took delight in superintending, and in the perfection
of household work; and the world, high and
low, did not commonly feel wasted as it so often
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
does now; and our tongues ran on, on the servant
problem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SERVANT PROBLEM DISCUSSED</div>

<p class='c014'>“A little more education,” argued Constance, “and
perhaps the world will move more smoothly. If all the
girls could play a tune or two and knew a little more
French, the world would not be so proud of one-finger
melodies, or isolated syllables of Gallic, that we can
vouch are incomprehensible to the native understanding.
’Tis not to be expected, as old Betty in the Dingle says,
‘as the sun can find all the crannies at once.’ Education
is slow because gentility is great, and real love
or desire for knowledge rare. What we want is not, as
Montaigne said, ‘more education, but better education.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we wandered on to what is knowledge and
what are the things worth knowing, and no doubt the
hour till tea would have passed all too quickly, if we
had not been interrupted by Bess, who dashed downstairs
breathless, and bubbling over with excitement.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A letter,” she cried, “and a letter all for me.
Nana,” she explained, “said I must not say ‘yes’
without your leave. But why should papa only have
dogs as a matter of course? Here is the note.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I took the little crumpled paper from Bess’s hands.
It was from Maimie Armstrong and written to Bess by
a friend’s little girl. I read that “there are several
little pups. Mamma,” continued Maimie, “says you
are to have one when it is old enough to leave old Nick-nack.
They are all blind now and cannot see, but suck
all day. One shall be sent in a basket.</p>

<p class='c014'>“P.S.—I didn’t write all this myself, because ink
often goes wrong with me and I can’t spell, but James,
the footman, has done it for me.” And then in a very
large round child’s hand. “Your loving friend, Maimie
Armstrong.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
I straightened out the little sheet and then looked
round at Bess. She was literally trembling with excitement
and she could hardly speak, but somehow she
managed to gasp out, “Mama, I cannot live without
a pug-pup.” For the moment I believed she was speaking
the truth, so I answered, “Yes, dear, we must have
even a pug-pup if it is a necessity.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes,” cried Bess, with rapture; “and then I
shall be quite, quite happy ever afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What a good thing it is to be a child,” said Constance,
softly. “One wants everything so badly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At my acceding to Bess’s request, Bess ran to me
and hugged me rapturously, and called out to old Nana,
who had just appeared at the head of the stairs, “I
told you so; and the pug-pup is to live in the nursery.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Nana did not greet this news with the pleasure
expected of her, and as the two mounted the stairs, I
heard my old female retainer grumble something to
herself. But give her time, as Bess always says, “and
Nana will always come round, and find you a sweet out
of some cupboard before she’s done.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My old Nana keeps her chamber spotless, tells my
little maid long old stories of Shropshire, and wages
ceaseless war against fringes and furbelows in her
nursery maid. “God made me a good servant,” she
always says, with austere pride. And I add reverently,
“The Lord only knows the extent of her long devotion.”
It has weathered many storms, and has bid defiance to
the blasts of misfortune, and to the frosts of adversity.
Like the gnarled oak of one of her native forests, Nan
has sheltered many young generations of saplings, and
in her master’s family have centred her interests, her
pleasures: to their well-being she has given her life.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the evening, after dinner, I went up the old stone
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
staircase that leads to the nursery. Bess was sleeping
peacefully, but she was not hugging, as is her wont, her
favourite old doll “Sambo.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PUG PRINCE</div>

<p class='c014'>“Her wouldn’t to-night,” explained Nana, “my
little lamb; her thinks of nothing but the pug-pup. I
holds to dolls for little ladies, but Miss Bess, she holds
to dogs for herself. ‘Oh, Nana,’ her said, when I was
bathing her, ‘I could not live without dogs. God makes
them into brothers for me.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I said, ‘Why do you like ’em like that? ’Tis
almost a sin.’ She answered, ‘God never makes them
answer back; and then we can do with different toys.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” concluded Nan, pensively, as she took up her
sewing, “my old aunt said God Almighty made caterpillars
for something, and I suppose even dogs b’aint
made for nought, leastways, they be pleasures to some.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I laughed, for behind me, padding up the stairs
reluctantly, but faithfully, I saw through the open door
my great Dane.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should miss Mouse dreadfully. Bess is right,” I
cried, “one’s dog never answers back, and is loving and
sympathetic at all times, in and out of season.” I passed
gently out of the room and went downstairs. I left the
dimity-hung chamber, and as I did so I had a vision of
a little bright, happy face. At seven, a pug-pup may
seem almost a fairy prince, or possess all the gifts of the
philosopher’s stone. “Oh, happy childhood,” I said,
“which asks so little and wants it so badly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Great logs of wood blazed gaily on the great open
hearth of the chapel hall, between delicate bronze
Italian dogs. The moon was shining down from a sky
of placid splendour, and the little oratory looked in the
evening light wonderful, and mystic. Through the old
irregular lattice windows I felt as if a message of peace
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
was being brought to me. No sound of bird or cry of
beast greeted my ears. A copy of Thomas à Kempis’
immortal book lay near me on the table. I took it up
and read.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In the Cross is Salvation, in the Cross is life. In
the Cross is the perfection of sanctity.” I read the
beautiful words over, and over again. How exquisite
the language is. What hope and radiance beam through
every syllable. “Yes,” I said, in the stillness of this
wonderful place, “I too can hear His message, for this
once also was a holy and austere place, where men
poured out their lives in the ecstasies of prayer.” Then
I thought of the monk of St. Agnes as I saw him in
imagination across the long centuries, denying himself
all that makes life sweet, and welcome to most men, and
devoting himself heart and soul to holy meditation, and
still holier penmanship. Idleness he abhorred; labour,
as he said, was his companion, silence his friend, prayer
his auxiliary. There seemed almost an overpowering
sense of holiness in the serene calm of the Abbey,
and I strove against it as if the air were unduly
burdened with an incense too strong to bear. I rose
and went to the door and let in the night air. I saw
the dim outline of the trees and the dimmer outline of
garden-bed and bush. As I looked, in strange contrast,
the glory of the summer days returned to me. In the
cold of January my mind floated back to the joy of
faintly budding woods, to deep red roses, to the rich
perfume of bee-haunted limes, and to pure lines of
blossoming lilies. All these I saw in my soul as I stood
and gazed into the chill darkness. The flowers seemed
to laugh at me, and were accompanied by fair visions
of Joy, Love, and Life; but grim forlorn winter, the
symbol of the lonely soul in the mountain heights, has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
also its own beauties. I looked round again, and the
mystic sides of Renunciation held me fast. The peace
and devotion of the past seemed to hold and chain
me with irresistible force. I shut the door and stood
again in the place where saints had stood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOLY PLACE</div>

<p class='c014'>Beside me was the great stone altar with its seven
holy crosses, before which kneeling kings had received
the sacrament, and where saint and sinner had received
alike absolution. Outside alone the stars were witnesses
of my presence. They shone as they had shone a
thousand years ago, as they will shine a thousand years
to come. Pale, mystic, and eternal, a holy dew of wonder
seemed to fall upon my shoulders, the Peace of God is
not of this world, nor can it be culled from the joys of
life.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is the Christian’s revelation of glory, but those
that serve can hear at times the still calm voice of benediction
in such silent places as this, or in the supreme
moment of duty, “for in the cross is the invincible sanctuary
of the humble, in the cross of Christ is the key
of Paradise.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning I rose early. There was much to
do, for life can be as busy in the country as in town. I
wrote my letters, and according to my constant custom—much
laughed at, be it said, by many friends—jotted
down my engagements, duties, and pleasurable excitements
for the day. There were—</p>

<p class='c014'>Some blankets to send to the poor. My list of flower
seeds. And then Bess and I were to go sledging in the
lanes.</p>

<p class='c014'>To English people sledging never seems a quite real
amusement, and always to belong a little to the region
of a fairy-story.</p>

<p class='c014'>Punctual to the moment, Burbidge appeared with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
long sheets of foolscap, and we made out the list of
seeds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Burbidge,” I said grandly, as he handed to me the
sheets of paper, “I leave the vegetables to you, save
just my foreign pets.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge bowed graciously and we were about to
begin, when he could not resist his usual speech about
disliking foreign men, foreign flowers, and foreign seeds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I rejoined slyly; “but you must remember
how many people liked the Mont D’Or beans and praised
your Berlin lettuces.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, so long as you and the squire were pleased, I
know my duty,” replied Burbidge, mollified.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Which is?” I could not refrain from asking, for
the old man has always his old-fashioned formula at
the tip of his tongue.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Which is,” repeated old Burbidge, rehearsing his old-fashioned
catechism solemnly, “watering in droughts,
weeding all weathers, and keeping a garden throughout
peart and bobbish as if it war the Lord’s parlour.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is a very good duty,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” answered Burbidge, complacently; “new
fangled scholards haven’t got far beyond that, not even
when they puts Latin names to the job. They have
County Councils now, and new tricks of all sorts, but
’tis a pity as so many get up so early to misinform
themselves, but there be some as allus will live underground
and call it light, and there be none so ignorant
as they as only reads books. They be born bats for all
the garnish of their words.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After which there followed a long pause—then
Burbidge handed me his list of vegetables.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I haven’t forgotten the foreigneerers,” he said indulgently,
“carrots, potatoes, peas, onions, celery, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
greens, sprouts, and curls—enough even for a kitchen
man, and the Lord Almighty would have a job to know
what a Froggy cannot chop up or slip into a sauce.
One might stock a county with extras, if one listened to
they.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOVE IN THE MIST</div>

<p class='c014'>Then we turned to the flower list. Burbidge pointed
with a big brown finger to my entry of “Love in the
Mist,” as I wrote, for I proposed having great patches
of it in front of my lines of Madonna lilies, varied by
patches of carnations, stocks, and zinnias in turns.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t hold,” he said severely, “to so much bluery
greenery before my lilies. There won’t be no colour in
my borders.” Then when I protested, he added, “You
like it, mam, ‘cause it has a pretty name. There’s a
deal in a name, but ’tisn’t all that call it ‘Love in the
Mist.’ ‘Devil in the Bush’ was what my mother used
to call it, and other folks ‘Laddie in a Hole.’ But
there’s a deal too much talked about such nonsense.
Leave the maids alone, and eat your vittals, is what I
tell my boys, and then there’d be a lot of cakey nonsense
left out of the world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Burbidge, knowing my heart was, what he
terms, “set on blows,” bowed slowly, and vanished.</p>

<p class='c014'>Left to myself, I looked down the catalogue of flower
seeds and ordered to my heart’s content; packets of
shadowy Love in the Mist, and Eckford’s delightful sweet
peas in exquisite shades of red, mauve, lavender, rose,
pink, scarlet, and pale yellow. Then I thought of the
sweetness of Centaury, the brilliant yellow of the Coreopsis,
the perfume of the mulberry-tinted Scabious, and
the azure glory of the Convolvulus Minor. I recalled the
beauty of the godetias and the opal splendour of the larkspurs,
while the gorgeous shades of the Malopes seemed
to make an imaginary background of magnificence in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
my borders, and in my mind’s eye the diaphanous beauty
of the Shirley poppies seemed to add to the gorgeous
sunlight of even sovereign summer itself. And lastly, as
the latest annuals of the year, I did not forget to add
some single moon-faced sunflowers, such as I once saw
at Linley in the old garden there—worn, white, shadowy
creatures with the tears of autumn in their veins.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a great delight to order your own flower list.
It means a true wealth of beauty in the future, brilliant
colours and sweet odours, and the promise of so much
in the present. Promise is often like the petals of last
year’s roses, and yet full of delights is the garden of
imagination. I sat on and dreamt of my future borders,
in which no frost nor hail, nor any evil thing would fall,
and sat on drawing little squares and rounds on white
paper borders when my leisure was suddenly disturbed.
Too much leisure is not given to any mother of the
twentieth century. And Bess entered like a thunder
clap.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mama,” she called, “Mama, Crawley declares that
you are going out sledging. May I come—I want to,
I want to?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I answered; “but you must do just as I tell
you, get out if I tell you, and not do anything foolish.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess agreed to all my stipulations. What would she
not have agreed to, to gain her point? And conditions,
before they happen, do not sit heavily on a child’s soul.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last even luncheon was over, and Bess awaited
the sledge, expectant and triumphant on the mounting-block.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just as Bess was sure for the hundredth time that it
must be almost tea time, and that something must have
happened to Bluebell, the sound of the bells rang out
across the frosty air.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
“It comes, it comes,” cried Bess, rapturously, “and
oh, mama, isn’t it fun. It’s better than walnuts on
Sundays, or damming up a stream with Burbidge, or
even helping to wash Mouse with Fred,” and my little
maid, in a flame-coloured serge mantle trimmed with
grey Chinchilla fur, leapt about with excitement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WE JOURNEY IN A SLEDGE</div>

<p class='c014'>A minute later, and Fremantle and the footman ran
out with blankets, which they carried in their arms in
great brown-paper parcels. Each parcel bore the name
of one of the seven old women who were that afternoon to
receive a pair of blankets. We got in, and then somehow
all the parcels were piled up and round us—how I cannot
really say, but like a conjuring trick somehow it was
done. At last, when all was put in and Bess screamed
out “safe,” I shook the reins, old Bluebell looked round
demurely, and then trotted off. Mouse gave a deep bay
of exultation, Tramp and Tartar yelped frantically, and
away we went.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dogs barked, the bells jingled, and a keen, crisp
wind played upon us, packages and pony.</p>

<p class='c014'>We drove along the old town. We passed the old
Town Hall with its whipping-post, and so up High Street
past the beautiful old house known as Ashfield Hall, once
the old town house of the Lawleys, where Charles I. is said
to have slept during his wars, and where Prince Rupert
another time dined and rested with some of the gentlemen
of his guard. Ashfield Hall is a striking old house,
with a gateway, mullion and latticed windows, and
beyond extends the old street, known since the days of
the pilgrims as Hospital Street.</p>

<p class='c014'>Overhead stretched a laughing blue sky, and all
round was what Bess was pleased to term the Snow
Queen’s Kingdom. First of all, we went to Newtown.
We passed the red vicarage with its great dark green
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
ilex, and then up by the picturesque forge, where the
blacksmith was hammering on a shoe, away by the
strange old cottages on the Causeway, with a fall below
them into the road of some seven or eight feet, on we
went as quickly as fat Bluebell could be persuaded to
trot. Then we mounted the hill, and I got out and led
the old pony to ease its burden, for a sledge is always a
heavy weight when it has to be dragged up hill. At last
old Jenny James’s cottage was reached, and her parcel
duly handed out.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I like giving things,” said Bess, superbly. “It
seems to make you happier.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I answered; “but gifts are best when we
give something that we want ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t you want the blankets, mama?” asked Bess,
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, not exactly, dear,” I answered. “Giving them
didn’t mean that I had to go without my dinner, or even
had to give up ordering my seed list this morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Must one really do that,” asked Bess sadly, “before
one can give anything?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps, little one,” I said, “to taste the very best
happiness.” Then there was a little pause, which was
at last broken by Bess turning crimson and saying—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mamsie, I think it must be very, very difficult to be
quite, quite happy.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIFTS TO THE POOR</div>

<p class='c014'>I did not explain, but saw from Bess’s expression that
I had sown a grain of a seed, and wondered when it
would blossom. Then we turned round and slipped down
the hill at a brisk rattle, all the dogs following hotly
behind, to an old dame who had long had a promise of a
blanket. The old body came out joyfully and stood by
her wicket gate, beaming with pleasure. It is an awful
thing, sometimes, the joy of the poor over some little
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
gift. It brings home to us at times our own unworthiness
more than anything else.</p>

<p class='c014'>Old Sukey, as she is called by her neighbours, took
her blankets from Bess with delight. “I shall sleep
now,” she said, “like a cat by the hearth, come summer
come winter,” and her old wrinkled face began to twitch,
and tears to rise in her poor old rheumy eyes. “Pretty
dear,” she said to Bess, “’tis most like a blow itself. I
wish I had a bloom to offer, but ’tis only a blessing now
that I can give thee.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again we turned, and pattered back post-haste up the
Barrow Road to a distant cottage.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is it a good thing to get a blessing?” asked Bess,
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A very good thing, for it makes even the richest
richer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then,” answered Bess, “when I grow up I mean
to get a great many blessings.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How, little one, will you do that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why,” answered Bess, “I shall give to everybody
everything they want, and buy for all the children all
the toys that I can find.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But supposing that you are not rich, that you
haven’t money in your purse, or a cheque-book from
the bank like papa?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I shall have to pray—and that will do it, for
I’m sure the good Lord wouldn’t like to disoblige me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At last all our visits were paid, and we had left
seven happy old souls, whom it was a comfort to think
would all sleep the sounder for our visit of that day.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we drove home, Bess suddenly turned round and
said—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mamsie, why can’t they buy blankets?”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is very hard for the child-mind to grasp that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
necessities of life—bread, blankets, and beds—do not
come, in a child’s language, “all by themselves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Puppies, pets, and chocolates, children can understand
have to be paid for; but the dull things, they
consider, surely ought to grow quite naturally, like the
trees outside the nursery windows, all by themselves,
and of their own accord, as they would say.</p>

<p class='c014'>I tried to explain to Bess what poverty really was, and
told her what it would mean to have no money, but to
buy the absolute bare necessities of life. Bess listened
open-mouthed, and at the end exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why has God given me so much, and to poor
children, then, so little?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder,” I replied; “but, anyway, as you have
got so much, you must do what you can to make other
little boys and girls happier. For God, when he gives
much, will also ask much some day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess did not answer, and we drove back in silence.
It was very still along the country lanes, save for the
tinkling of the joyous bells. Behind us followed our
pack, Mouse panting somewhat, for she had fed at
luncheon time, not wisely, but too well; but Tramp and
Tartar scampered gaily after us. The whole country
seemed enveloped in a white winding-sheet, and the sunlight
was dying out of the west. A soft white mist was
stealing up over all, but the voice of death was gentle,
calm, almost sweet, across the silent world. Cottages
looked out by their windows, blinking, and appeared
almost as white as the snow beneath them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Old Bluebell seemed to know that her trot to the
Abbey was her last journey, and went with a good will.
We passed the new hospital, dashed down Sheinton
Street, and so into the Italian gates by the old Watch
Tower of the abbot’s, beyond the old Bull Ring
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
where, through many centuries, bulls were baited by
dogs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“I WANT TO BE HAPPY”</div>

<p class='c014'>As we drew up before the door, Bess exclaimed,
regretfully—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, mama, why has it all stopped? I should
like driving in a sledge to go on for ever and ever.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I kissed the little maid, and we went into tea. Bess
hardly spoke, and I thought her wearied by the excitement
of the drive, but that night, when I went up to
see her in bed, she called out—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mamsie, mamsie, come quite close. A secret.”
So I sat down on the little bed, and the little arms
went round my neck. “Mama, I have looked out a
heap—a heap of toys—to send off to poor children.
My new doll Sabrina, my blue pig, my little box of tea
things, the new Noah’s Ark, but Nana will not pack
them up. She says they’re too good for poor children.
Isn’t she wicked, for I want to give them all, and to be
happy—happy as you mean me to be.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Some weeks had passed, and I had been away from
home. Rain had fallen, and the snow had vanished like
a dream—the first dawn of spring had come. Not
spring as we know her in the South of France or in
Southern Italy—gorgeous, gay, debonair—but shy, coy,
and timid. The spring of the North is like a maiden of
the hills, timid and reserved, yet infinitely attractive,
what our French friends would call “une sensitive.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was, as yet, very little appearance that winter
“brear Winter,” as Spenser calls him, was routed and
obliged with his legions of frost and snow, to fly before
the arrival of youth and life, and the breath of
triumphant zephyrs. A spring in the North is chiefly
proclaimed by the voice of the stormcock in some apple
tree, by the green peering noses of snowdrops, and here
and there a crimson tassel on the hazel tree and
larch; but, above all, by the splendour of golden and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
purple lights which come and go across the hillsides
and athwart wood and coppice. The turf, as I walked
along, I noticed was moist and soft, and oozed up under
my feet. February fill-dyke, as she is called, had come
in due order, and in appointed form. Little puddles
glistened on the drive, and for all the patches here and
there of blue, there were leaden shadows and grey
clouds, and it was wise, if you wandered abroad, to have
at hand the protecting influence of an umbrella. I
walked up the back drive, till I stood before the well
of our patron saint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “HOLY ONE OF WENLOCK”</div>

<p class='c014'>Long centuries ago the holy and beautiful daughter
of Merewald, King of Hereford, according to old tradition,
came here and founded a nunnery. The story runs that
St. Milburgha, pursued by the importunities of a Welsh
prince, found a refuge at Wenlock, and gathered round
her a community of devoted women.</p>

<p class='c014'>Tradition tells the story of how the saint fled on
one occasion to Stoke, a hamlet in the Clee Hills. The
legend says that she fell fainting from her milk-white
steed as she neared a spring there. As she did so
she struck her head against a stone, causing blood to
flow freely from the wound. At that time, about the
middle of February, some countrymen were occupied
in sowing barley in a field which was called the Placks,
and seeing the lovely lady in so sad a plight, they ran
to her assistance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Water,” she wailed, but none seemed at hand.
Then St. Milburgha bade her steed strike his hoof
against the rock, and, believed the hagiologists, water,
clear, wonderful and blessed, leapt forth at her command.
As it flowed, the lady is reported to have
said: “Holy water, flow now, and from all time.”
Then she stretched forth her hands and blessed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
fields where the barley had been sown, and immediately,
before the astonished eyes of all beholders, the grain
burst forth into tender blades of grass. Then St.
Milburgha turned to the countrymen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The wicked prince,” she said, “and his pack of
bloodhounds are close upon me, therefore I must fly.”
And she bade them adieu, but not till she had told them
to sharpen their scythes, for the reaping of the barley
should take place that night.</p>

<p class='c014'>All came to pass as the Blessed One had foretold, for
as the countrymen were busy reaping their grain, the
heathen prince and his followers arrived on the scene.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the labourers were true and faithful hearts, and
neither threats nor promises could extract from them in
what direction the Lady Milburgha had fled.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the prince saw that the peasants had begun
to reap the grain that had been sown the self-same day,
a great awe fell upon him and his lords, and he vowed
that it was a vain and foolish thing to fight against the
Lord, and his anointed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Other old writers tell how the river Corve, at the
voice of God, saved Lady Milburgha; and how, as soon
as she had passed over its waters, from an insignificant
little brooklet it swelled into a mighty flood which effectually
barred the prince’s progress. Amongst other incidents
mentioned by Saxon chroniclers, we hear that
St. Milburgha drove away the wild geese from the plots
of the poor. Many are the legends of the beautiful
Shropshire saint that are still cherished in the wild
country between the Severn and the Clee. She was as
fair as she was good, it was said, and old writers told how,
when a veil once fell from her head in the early morning
sunshine, it remained suspended in the air until replaced
by her own hand, and how she wrought a miracle
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
by prayer and brought back to life the son of a poor
widow; while all the while, a mystic and sacred flame
burnt beside her, a visible manifestation of her sanctity,
for all to see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SAINT’S WELL</div>

<p class='c014'>I thought of all these beautiful old legends, fairy-stories
of grace, they seemed to me, as I wandered up
the back lane and paused before the saint’s well at
Wenlock, which is still said to cure sore eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I stopped to gaze down upon the deep well below,
I noticed that the little wicket gate was open, and that
a child with a little jug was about to descend the stairs
to fetch what she termed in the Shropshire tongue, “a
spot o’ water.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you no water at home, my child, that you
come here?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes,” replied the little maiden, Fanny Milner
by name, “there be a hougy drop in our well after the
rains; but grandam says I must get some from here,
or she’ll never be able to read her chapter come Sunday
afternoon, with glasses or no glasses. Grandam says
as it have a greater power of healin’ than ever lies in
doctor’s messes, or than in bought stuffs neither. It be
a <em>blessed</em> water, grandam says, and was washed in by a
saint—and when saints meddle with water, they makes,
grandam says, a better job of it than any doctor, let
him be fit to burst with learning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I smiled at the apple-cheeked little lass’s quaint talk,
and helped her to fill her jar. The belief in the healing
powers of the old well lingers on, and many of the
inhabitants of Much Wenlock are still of opinion that
water fetched from St. Milburgha’s well can cure many
diseases, and particularly all malign affections of the
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the holy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
wells of many Welsh and Shropshire wells degenerated
into Wishing wells. They then lost their sacred
character, and became centres of rural festivities.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is said that at Much Wenlock on “Holy Thursday,”
high revels were held formerly at St. Milburgha’s well;
that the young men after service in the church bore
green branches round the town, and that they stopped
at last before St. Milburgha’s well. There, it is alleged,
the young maidens threw in crooked pins and “wished”
for sweethearts. Round the well, young men drank
toasts in beer brewed from water collected from the
church roof, whilst the women sipped sugar and water,
and ate cakes. After many songs and much merriment,
the day ended with games such as “Pop the Green Man
down,” “Sally Water,” and “The Bull in the Ring,”
which games were followed by country dances, such as
“The Merry Millers of Ludlow,” “John, come and kiss
me,” “Tom Tizler,” “Put on your smock o’ Monday,”
and “Sellingers all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Such was the custom at Chirbury, at Churchstoke,
and at many of the Hill wakes, and from lonely cottage
and village hamlets the boys and girls gathered together,
and danced and played in village and town.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>THE RED WALLED GARDEN.</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>After shopping in the town, I entered the little
old red-walled garden where my annuals blossom in the
lovely long June days. All looked sad and brown, and
“packed by” for rest, as Burbidge calls it. I noticed,
however, a few signs of returning life. The snowdrops had
little green noses, which peered above the ground, and
here and there the winter aconites had bubbled up into
blossom. What funny little prim things they were with
their bonnets of gold, and their frills of emerald green. I
noted, also, that the “Mezeron-tree,” as Bacon calls it,
was budding. How sweet would be its fragrance a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
weeks later, I thought, under the glow of a warm March
sun.</p>

<p class='c014'>I passed along, and looked at a line of yellow crocuses.
The most beautiful of all crocuses, veritable lamps of
fire in a garden, are those known as the Cloth of Gold.
The golden thread was full of promise, but as yet no
blossom was expanded. How glorious they would be when
they opened to the sunshine. There is indeed almost
heat in their colour, it is so warm and splendid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANY-COLOURED STARLINGS FLIT</div>

<p class='c014'>As I stood before these signs of dawning life, two
starlings flitted across the garden. How gay they were
in their brilliant iridescent plumage! The sun, as they
passed me, struck the sheen of their backs, and they
seemed to shine a hundred colours, all at once. I tried
to count the colours that the sun brought forth in them,
gold, red, green, blue, gray and black with silver lights;
but as I named the colours, words seemed bald and
inadequate to describe the beauty and mutability of
their hundred tints, for, as they moved, each colour
changed, dissolved, reappeared and vanished, to grow
afresh in some more wonderful and even more exquisite
tint. And then suddenly the sun was obscured behind
a cloud, and my starlings, that seemed a minute ago to
hold in their plumage the beauty of the sun and the
moon and of the stars, became in a twinkling poor
brown, everyday, common little creatures. Like Ashputtel
when the charm was gone, they looked common
little vulgar creatures, and as they flew over the wall into
the depths of the ivy on the ruined church, I wondered
why I had ever admired them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Starlings, some fifty years ago, were often kept as
pets. Burbidge has told me that they are the cleverest
mimics that breathe, being “born apes,” so to speak.
Now, however, my old friend declares, “none will do with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
them, for nobody cares for nought but popinjays, and
then they must have the colours of a gladiolus married
to the voice of a piano.” So the English starling is no
longer a village pet. A few minutes later, and Burbidge
told me that a spray of Chionodoxa Luciliæ was out.</p>

<p class='c014'>I peered round and I saw some little hard china like
buttons, folded tight in a sheath, and beyond, a cluster of
bronze noses, about a quarter of an inch above the ground.
How lovely they will be, I thought, all these delicate
spring flowers. All blue, and all wonderfully beautiful
from the deep sapphire blue of the Chionodoxa Sardensis,
to the pale lavender of the dainty and exquisite
Alleni.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yes, the world is alive, I said, and laughed; for I
knew that spring must come in spite of snows and
frosts, that the breath of life had gone forth, mysterious,
wonderful, the miracle of all the miracles, and that the
joy of spring and the glory of summer must come, as
inevitably as death and winter.</p>

<p class='c014'>I turned and inspected a large bed of Chinese
Peonies. I moved a little of the protecting bracken
placed there by the loving hand of Burbidge, and peeped
into the litter. Yes, they too, had heard the call of
spring. A few shoots had pierced through the soil, and
they were of the richest blood-red colour, like the
shoots of the tea-roses on the verandah of our hotel
at Mentone. They were of the deepest crimson, with
a light in them that recalled the splendour of a dying
sun. Then I covered up the shoots quickly for fear
of night frosts, but with hope in my heart, for everywhere
I knew the earth must burst into bud and blossom;
and as I listened to the storm-cock in the plantation, I
rejoiced with him in the lengthening days, and in the
growing sunshine.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A JOYOUS CHAFFINCH</div>

<p class='c014'>I passed out of the garden, and walked down the
stone stairs, through the old wrought-iron gate, that is
said to have belonged to the house where the Rye
House Plot was hatched. Just outside, and perched
on a silver holly, I saw a lovely cock chaffinch. A
second later, he was strutting gaily up and down on
the grass! What a grand fellow he was, with his
lavender head, his greenish-grey back, his salmon
breast, and the brilliant white bars on his wings! What
a cheery, light-hearted little creature! “Joyeux comme
un pinson,” the French say, and he is certainly the most
light-hearted of English birds. The Twink, or Bachelor
bird he is often nicknamed, for when winter comes,
many of the cocks stretch their wings and fly off to
foreign parts and leave the hens behind. The pied-finch
is his name in the village. By nature a most joyous
bird, the pied-finch is the last of the summer singers,
singing gaily into July, when the thrush and blackbird
are mute. I stood and watched him as he hopped
about the sward. He took no notice that I was near,
for the Bachelor bird is very fearless and curiously little
apprehensive, or timid. All of a sudden, I turned round
and saw my great hound Mouse behind me. “Mouse!”
I cried, and with a bound she was beside me. For
the first twenty-four hours after my return, Mouse is
miserable out of my sight. She always gives me a
boisterous welcome, and will not leave me for a moment.
She sniffs at my boxes, watches me out of the corner
of her eye, and wanders round me, trying often in a
foolish, dumb way to block my passage, if she thinks I
wish to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Panting, and running behind my dog, followed Bess.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mums,” she said, “we couldn’t think where you
was gone. We hunted everywhere. ‘Like enough,’
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
Burbidge said, ‘you was hunting for flowers.’ But
don’t bother about little spikes and green things, for
Mouse and I want you badly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hals is coming,” continued Bess, “and this time
without his crab-tree governess. Burbidge says, ‘Give
me a <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> to turn the cream sour;’ and declares that
‘You could make vinegar out of her!’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, then, my dear,” I said, “you and Hals can
thoroughly enjoy yourselves, for you will be alone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” answered Bess, “for when I saw Hals I said,
‘Nothing but old, old clothes—clothes that will nearly
want gum to stick them on, and that won’t mind any
mud.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you enjoy yourself at Hals’ birthday?” I
asked, for on that eventful day I was away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should think I did, mamsie,” and Bess’s eyes
glistened at the recollection. “There was no conjurer,
but the dearest little white dog in the world, that did
tricks, and he knew more tricks than a pig at a fair,
Nana said; and after that Cousin Alice, Miss Jordan,
read us some stories and poetry. First of all, she sang
us such nice old songs about ‘Mary, Mary, quite contrary,’
‘Little Boy Blue,’ and ‘I saw Three Ships come
Sailing,’ and then she went on reading poetry. She
read us the ‘Ancient Mariner,’ and ‘Sister Helen,’ and
I sat on her knee; but Hals wouldn’t sit on his mother’s,
because he said people were looking, and boys had better
sit on their own chairs. And ‘Sister Helen’ was quite
real, and made me feel creepy, creepy. It was all
about two sisters—they hated some one, and made an
image, and they dug pins into it, and then they repeated
bad words, and the person for whom it was meant
got iller and iller and died; and Hals and me we
liked it.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
So, chattering all the way, Bess and I regained the
house.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will there be cake—my favourite cake?” inquired
Bess, “the one that Hals likes best of all, with apricot
jam and chocolate on the top?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I answered, “and Auguste has promised to
make it himself. But only one helping. You must try
and be wise, little girl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must try,” said Bess, but not very hopefully.</p>

<p class='c014'>Half an hour later and Hals arrived, without <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>
Schliemann. We all felt relieved; the two children
embraced hurriedly, as if life was all too short to get
in all the fun of an afternoon spent in each other’s
company; and then Bess said, “You can go now,”
sharply to the little maid who had brought him over.
“We don’t want to be unkind, but we want to be quite,
quite alone, please;” then, thinking that she had not
been quite courteous, Bess ran impetuously out of the
room. “Poor thing!” she explained to me a minute
after, “she must read, because she cannot play; she
cannot help it;” and Bess gave Jane a story-book.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will find that very amusing,” I heard her say
through the open door. “It is all about a naughty
girl, but she couldn’t help being naughty, ’cause it was
her nature.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Jane went up to the nursery, and a minute
later Bess and Harry bounced off together. Before
leaving me she whispered something into his ear.</p>

<p class='c014'>An hour later and Fremantle rang the bell for
tea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GREAT, GREAT SECRET</div>

<p class='c014'>After a few moments of waiting Bess and Hals
reappeared. They whispered loudly, but I pretended
not to hear what they said, for Bess told me with
flashing eyes that they had a great, great secret.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
“The greatest secret, Mum Mum, that we ever had
in our lives.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Their faces looked scarlet, and as to their hands, it
is hard to say of what colour they were originally. It
was, however, Bess’s special <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i>, so I said nothing
tactless about cleanliness, nor did I allude to whispering
being against the canons of good manners; for there
are moments when a mother should have eyes not to
see, and ears not to hear, and as a wise friend once said
to me, “half the wisdom of life is knowing when to be
indulgent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I need not have feared any excess on the part of the
children as regarded the cake and the jam, for they hardly
ate any, and Auguste’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</span></i> had only two small
slices cut out of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess, I saw, was under the influence of some great
excitement. She could hardly sit still a moment, and
fidgeted on her chair repeatedly, till I feared she would
topple backwards, chair and all.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last tea was over, and grace was said, and the
two children, breathless, and absorbed, begged leave to
go off.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I answered, “but not out of doors; for, see,
it is raining, and I promised your mother, Hals, that
you should not get wet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no, it’s nothing to do with puddles,” cried
Bess. “But, mum, may I take some pins from your
pincushion? Nurse won’t let me have as many as I
want. And then will you say that nobody—nobody is to
go near us?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well,” I answered, “only don’t do anything
that is really wrong.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess avoided my gaze, and did not answer, and a
minute later I heard the two children scuttle up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
newel staircase, and shortly after heard the muffled
sound of voices in the old tower of the Abbey that a
Lawley is said to have erected in the middle of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FAIRY-STORY</div>

<p class='c014'>About half an hour after, the children returned to me
in the chapel hall. Bess, I noticed, looked white and
fagged, and both children seemed exhausted by their
play, whatever it was, so I made them sit quiet, fetched
my embroidery, and began to tell them a fairy-story.
I meandered along the paths of fiction. I fear my story
had but little plot, but it had fiery dragons, wild beasts,
a fairy prince, and a beautiful fairy princess, and, in
the background, a wicked ogre. And as I talked, the
children sat entranced.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see,” I said, as I heard the front-door bell
ring, and heard the tramp of horses outside, “the prince
was to have everything, all that his heart could wish—dogs,
the golden bow and arrows, the azure ball, and
the deathless crimson rose—as long as he restrained his
temper, and never gave way to fits of violent passion.
But if he swore at his old nurse, Ancoretta, or struck
the goat-herd, Fritz, or even pinched the goose-girl,
Mopsa, palace, dogs, bow, ball and rose were all to
disappear like a flash of lightning, and he was to
become again the poor little bare-legged village lad.
Then the princess was to be carried off by fiery dragons,
and never return till he, Florizel, had been able to grow
good and pitiful again, and to do some lowly, humble
service to some poor old dame that everybody else
despised, and was unkind to.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this point of my story, Fremantle entered and
announced the carriage.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go on, go on,” cried the children in one breath.
“We want to hear what happened!”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
But I answered, shaking my head, “How Prince
Florizel was rude to his tutor, ungrateful to his old
nurse, and beat his faithful foster-brother, Fritz, is
another story, as Mr. Kipling would say; and all this
you must wait to hear in the second volume of my mind,
which will appear on Easter Monday, when Hals shall
come over, if his mother can spare him, and we three
will all sail off in fairy barks with silken sails to the far
and happy land of Fancy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So Harry departed, attended by Jane, and Bess sat
on in silence looking hard into the fire, and then early,
and of her own accord, pleaded fatigue and slipped off
to bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just as I was finishing dinner I saw old Nurse
Milner standing in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing wrong, nurse?” I asked, starting up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing very wrong,” answered old Nana, cautiously;
“leastways, Miss Bess is not ill, but she seems
out of sorts and won’t say her prayers to-night, and will
keep throwing herself about, till I think she’s bound to
fall out of bed. I have asked her what’s the matter, but
she’s as secret as a state door. She and Master Harry
have been up to some tricks, I’ll be bound, for I don’t
hold to children playin’ by themselves, as if they were
nothing but lambkins in a meadow. You can’t tell what
they won’t be up to, but this you may be sure of, to
childers left by themselves, mischief is natural sport.”
And old Nana glared, and made me feel very small.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No great harm done this time,” I said, and went
upstairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s the matter, little girl?” I asked. I took a
little hot, feverish hand and pressed her to tell me why
she would not say her prayers.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first Bess was sullen—turned her head away, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
would not speak; but she could not resist my kiss, and
at last confession bubbled up to her lips.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LITTLE MAID’S CONFESSION</div>

<p class='c014'>“Mama,” she exclaimed vehemently, “I have been
wicked, very wicked—wicked as an ogre or a she-dragon.
Can you love me really and truly when you know what
I’ve done—really love me again?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am sure I can,” I answered, “only tell me. When
I know, I can help you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess buried her head against my shoulder, and then
rambled on rather incoherently—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you remember what I told you about Hals’
birthday—how there wasn’t a conjurer but a white dog,
and how, after the tricks were done, Miss Jordan read
us stories and told us poems? Well, there was one bit
of poetry that I wish I had never heard, nor Hals either,
and that was Sister Helen, because it has made me very
wicked. It has made me think of how I could pay out
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>. We both hate her, she does nothing but
punish; not punish you to make you good, but to
make you horrid. Hals catches it for not washing his
hands, for not brushing his hair, for not putting on his
coat, for losing his blotting-paper, for dropping his pencil.
Everything means a punishment with <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>. She
pounces on him like a cat, and she has him everywhere.”
Then, after a pause, Bess began again. “Hals
and I thought we would punish her, too—once and for
all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Bess,” I inquired; “but what did you do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mum, I was very naughty,” replied my little girl,
tearfully. “To-day, Hals and I went upstairs, up to
the tower, and I got a dustpan and two candle-ends,
and we lighted some sticks and some paper in the dustpan—I
stole some matches out of papa’s room—and
then we melted up the wax.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
“And then, Bess?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then, when the wax was sticky and horrid, we
stuck pins into it, and I said, ‘Please, God, let <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>
die.’ And Hals did not want to say it, but I made him,
for I said I wouldn’t have God angry with only me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And then I called out, ‘Let her die, God, in horrid
pain, like the snake last year that Burbidge killed and
that wouldn’t die straight off; and then, dear Lord, let
her go to hell and be kept there ever afterwards.’ But
Hals wouldn’t say that, because he had heard Parsons,
their stud groom, say you must give every beggar a
chance, so he bargained that she should come out one
day and have some chocolates. To which I said, if the
Lord lets her out of hell, it shall be only common chocolates,
not like those that Uncle Paul brought me back
from Paris. Then Hals agreed, Mum Mum; only he
said, for all she was a German woman, the chock was
not to be too nasty, seeing that she would only have
some once a year.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then Hals wanted to go away; but I said he
shouldn’t till we had done the whole job.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then he and I blew out the fire and stamped upon
the wax, and it was quite soft and squashy and I pricked
my foot; but nurse does not know, for Eliza bathed me
to-night, and Eliza did not notice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And after that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh,” sobbed Bess, “you will be very angry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never mind, go on,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then,” said Bess, steeled to the point, in a penetrating
broken chirp, “after that I told Hals we must
say bad words, for I knew that bad words can do a
great deal. But Hals couldn’t think of any, so I called
him a muff and a milksop, and I told him to repeat
after me all that I said.”</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW COULD I BE SO NAUGHTY?</div>

<p class='c014'>“What did you say?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mama, I called out ‘damn’ three times.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear, what a dreadful word! How did you
know it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, once I heard Uncle Paul say it when he ran
a nail in his boot; and once I remembered that Crawley
said it when he got his foot caught in a gate-post out
riding, and I have never forgotten it. And worse,”
continued Bess, “I called out, ‘hell! hell! hell!’ and
then I was frightened; but I didn’t let Hals see it, or
he would have said girls were only funks after all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, little girl, you have done wrong, and you
know it; for it is always wicked to curse anybody, and
mean to pray that some evil may befall them. But,”
I added, as I saw Bess’s tear-stained little face, “I am
sure you’re sorry; for think what a terrible thing it
would be if anything dreadful happened to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>, and
if you thought your wicked words had brought it about.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess’s composure by this time had quite broken
down, she broke out into a passionate fit of tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why don’t you beat me, why don’t you shake me,
or do something?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My poor little girl,” I answered, and I took her in
my arms and prayed God that He would purify my
little girl’s heart, and give her a pure white soul.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last Bess’s sobs grew less violent, and she lay
quiet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you feel better now?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” came back from Bess; “for the curses,
Mum Mum, seem to have gone out of the room and
to be dying away. Before you came, the whole place
seemed full of them, and eyes, great horrid eyes, seemed
to be looking at me everywhere, and I couldn’t rest, do
what I would.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
“Now you can sleep,” I said with a smile, “and I
will sit by you till all the evil spirits are gone, and guard
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So I sat on without speaking, and held Bess’s hands
till the dustman of children’s fancy came with his sandbags
and threw the sand of kindly oblivion into my
little maiden’s eyes, and she fell asleep. Then softly
and as delicately as I could, I untwined the little network
of fingers that had twined themselves so cunningly
around mine, and gave little Bess a parting kiss as I
glided out of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I returned to the chapel hall I found a letter
from Constance. In a postscript she told me that the
idea of the quilt was taking form.</p>

<p class='c014'>“From ‘Gerard’s Herbal’ I have chosen,” she
wrote, “the King’s Chalice, or Serins’ Cade; the Dalmatian
Cap; the Guinny Hen; the Broad-leaved Saffron;
Goat’s Rue, or the Herb of Grace; Ladies’ Smock;
Golden Mouse-ear; Solomon’s Seal; Star of Bethlehem;
Sops in Wine; Ales-hoof; Wolf’s Bane and Golden
Rod. I give you all the old names. On a scroll I
propose round the quilt or ‘bed hoddin,’ as Shropshire
folks would call it, to work wise and beautiful words
about sleep;” and her letter ended with an appeal to
me, to help her, by finding some apt saws and quotations
for this purpose. Of course I will; what a
delightful excuse for looking through the poets, I said
to myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at the old Dutch clock. Ten minutes, I
said, before going to bed. Ten minutes, ten golden
minutes, when it is not a duty to do anything, or a
matter of reproach to be idle. The fire was dying
softly down. I saw all faintly by the dim light of the
lamp—the dark panelling, the two Turners, the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
Bohemian bench, the stern outline of the altar, and
outside the still night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COMPANY OF SAINTS</div>

<p class='c014'>“Are you not afraid to sit by yourself?” a somewhat
foolish friend once asked me. “I should be
terribly alarmed of ghosts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Afraid of holy spirits?” I remember answering.
“No crime is associated with Wenlock. There is only
an atmosphere of prayer and saintliness there, a fragrance
from holy lives rising up to God in perpetual
intercession; surely such thoughts should make nobody
uneasy or unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know,” my friend had replied. “But lancet
windows, I know, always make me creepy—and living in
a church,” she added inconsequently, “would be almost
as bad as having a house with a curse. I am sure I
should always be dreaming of finding a walled-up skeleton,
or something mediæval and uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At which we had both laughed, and I confessed that
I liked being left to my angels and my prayers, and that
it was good to believe that one had a soul, and that all
the forces of God’s world were not comprised in steam,
the Press, and electricity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, as I sat on, my mind reverted to the little
child, sleeping, I hoped, peacefully upstairs. “Poor
little impetuous Bess,” I said to myself, “I trust some
day she will not break her heart against the bars of
earth. She wills, and wants, so strongly when the fit
is on her, and then afterwards, remorse, sorrow, and
despair.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The child is the father of the man, and in my mind’s
eye I saw my little maiden as she would be in womanhood—dark,
passionate, devoted, generous, impulsive, with
a golden heart, but self-willed and not easy to guide.
Heaven grant her pathway may not lie across many
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
briars, and that I may be able to protect, and water the
flowers, in the garden of her soul.</p>

<p class='c014'>All education is a hard matter, and we parents are
often like children groping in the dark. It takes all
that mother and father can do, friends and contemporaries,
and, after all, in Burbidge’s homely language,
is often “a parlous and weedy job.” We so often give
the wrong thing to our children, and, what is worse, the
wrong thing out of love and affection. We so often, as
Montaigne wrote, “stuff the memory and leave the conscience
and the understanding unfurnished and void.”
We are too often knowing only in what makes present
knowledge, “and not at all in what is past, no more
than which is to come.” We do not think sufficiently
of the development and growth of character. Above
all, few fathers and mothers try simply to make their
children good men and women, without which all is
lost; for, as the great essayist said, “all other knowledge
is hurtful to him or her who has not the science
of goodness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We must not be afraid of emotion, at least, not of
right emotion; nor must we be shy of offering our
highest tributes of admiration to honour, virtue, and
real greatness. We must not be ashamed to mention
honourable deeds, and we must teach our children that
honourable failure is better than dishonourable success.</p>

<p class='c014'>Life is not all an armchair for youth to rest in, or a
country of roast larks even for the youngest, and there
are higher and better things even than having “a good
time.” Such were the thoughts that flashed through
my brain as I lighted my yellow Broseley-ware candlestick
and went up the oak stairs to bed.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>The next day, as soon as I had finished breakfast, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
got a message from our old gardener, Burbidge, to the
effect that he wished to speak to me, and that at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BROTHER BEN IS “OVERLOOKED”</div>

<p class='c014'>I found the old man in the long lower passage of the
monks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it?” I asked. “Nothing wrong in the
garden?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not so bad as that; but ’tis about my brother as
I’ve come.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your brother, Burbidge?” I repeated. “I did
not even know that you had one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” replied Burbidge, “’tisn’t often as I speak
of him, and ’tis twenty year agone since I’ve seen ’im,
for when folks be hearty yer needn’t trot round the
country like a setter to see ’em; but now as Benjamin
is old and in danger, I think as I’d better have a day
off, and go and see him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where does he live?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“At Clun, just outside the town,” was Burbidge’s
reply. “He’s been there these seventy year, and more.
When he were quite a lad he lived at Bridgnorth, but
over seventy year he have a-lived with Farmers Benson—first
with Farmer James, then with his son Joshua,
and lastly with his grandson, Farmer Caleb. Benjamin
he have a-buried two wives and thirteen childer, and
the berrial of the lot have a-come upon him like tempest
in summer. But he have allus kept hale and hearty—till
this year.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Has Benjamin been able to work all these years?”
I inquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course he ’ave,” replied Burbidge, scornfully.
“Of course he did, till he war <em>overlooked</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Overlooked?” I said, and turned to Burbidge
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a pause, Burbidge, seeing that I did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
realize the full importance of his statement, repeated,
“Overlooked, and by a <em>black</em> witch too.” And then
he lowered his voice and added, “For all their education,
parsons, newspapers and what not, there be black
witches, and some of ’em has hearts as black as hell,
and can suck the very life out of a fellow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely your brother doesn’t believe that
<em>now</em>?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Doesn’t he,” answered Burbidge. “My brother
knows better than to disbelieve in devils and witches.
You don’t catch him going against the Word of God
like that. Yer might as well try to stir a puddin’ with
an awl, or to repeat a verse of Hebrew under a moonless
sky, as tear up the old belief in the old Shropshire
folk. The devil he won’t go out of Shropshire for all
the papers daily, and weekly, as ever town people read
or write; no, not even to make place for trains, and
motors. He ’ave his place here, and he’ll keep his
wenches, the witches, near him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what has happened to your brother?” I
asked, as soon as I could get a word in.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, just the same as has been happening for
years, and thousands of years to others, and which will
happen, whether Shropshire be ruled by a king or a
queen, and which be Gospel truth whatever they say,
and which may come dwang-swang to any Christian
man.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And thereupon I heard the story of how old
Benjamin Burbidge had been bewitched. I listened
amazed, for the tale was more like an incident in some
witch’s trial in James I.’s time than a story of modern
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BECKY SMOUT, THE WITCH</div>

<p class='c014'>“Yer must know,” continued our old gardener, “as
Benjamin war waggoner at Bottomly Farm—and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
have a-been so for years and years. And a fine team
his war—a team of roans and all mares—to get foals
off at the close. Well, and fat they war, and for all
he war old, horse and harness Benjamin minded surely.
His horses were to him like gold, and he put in elbow
grease as if he war a lusty lad of twenty in minding
’em. Well, one day his granddaughter Sally, who
keeps house for him, war mixin’ meal for the poultry,
when up comes Becky Smout as they call her there,
an old gangrel body, weazen, dark as walnut juice, and
the look of a vixen in her eyes. Some folks say she
came to Shropshire on a broomstick, and some seventy
year agone from Silverton on the Clee-side. ’Tis a
land of witches that Clee Hill, and allus have been a
stronghold of the devil, as old Parson Jackson used to
say. When Becky saw the poultry meat, her belly
craved for it. Her held out both hands ape-like and her
cried out, ‘Let it be a howgy sup, my wench.’ But
Sal war in a temper it seems. ‘Let be,’ she sang out;
‘dost think I’ve nought to do but to cram thy belly as
if thee were a yule-tide hog;’ and folks say with both
bowl, and spoon, Sal flung out in a fanteag, because it
seems Benjamin had promised her for her own gewgaws
what her could make by the sale of the fat hens
and the widdies come Christmas. And Becky her let
her rage and never, they say, spoke one single word,
but looked at her darkly, speered round, and wrote
some devil’s characters in the dust outside the door;
and as she passed down the lane they heard her laughin’,
laughin’ like an ecall on an April morning, fit to split
her sides in half. The next morning, when Sal got out
to feed her poultry, she picked up the speckled hen, and
a morning or two arter she found the yellow cock all
stiff and cold with a kind of white froth round his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
mouth. And after that, her war all of a tremble, war
Sal. Her began to hear voices, and to see things as
folks shouldn’t see, and to hear bits of noises everywhere.
And a kind of sweat seemed to ooze out from
her hands and feet, and her felt cold and hot all to a
time, and the doctor’s physic did her no good, nor
could any of Mrs. Benson’s draughts ease her. And
they sent her off to the sea to stay with a sister at
Rhyl; but Sal her came back queerer than ever, and
her wouldn’t speak, but would sit gaping and blinking
as if her couldn’t mak’ nothin’ out, nor understood
nought. And all the while Becky would prance about
aunty-pranty, and speer over the hedge, and laugh and
jabber and talk a heathen tongue.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Why, their own tongue.</em>”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it like?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, never you ask, marm,” replied Burbidge
sternly. “No pure-minded woman ever spoke that
tongue, but witches they take to it like widdies” (ducklings)
“to a horse pond. And for all Ben had cried
‘Fudge,’ and ‘You don’t catch an old fox nappin’,’ as
he did at the first when Sal were overtaken, he got
mighty fidgety and couldn’t stop still. He took to
dropping his pipe, wud begin a story and then wud
break off and laugh afore the joke was come, and his
speech got queer like Sal’s, and at last he could bear
it no longer, and he went off to Becky. And he took
a golden guinea that he had had off the first Mrs.
Benson, her as they called madam, for folks said that
she war a parson’s daughter, and that she had given
him for pulling her lad out of a brook over seventy
years agone, and that he valued like the apple of his
eye, and he pulled out the guinea from his waistcoat
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
pocket and he said ‘This be yourn,’ to Becky, ‘if for
the love of God you’ll take the curse off me and mine.’
But her wudn’t, wudn’t Becky, and her only laughed
and laughed, same as an ecall in the Edge wood. And
then Ben ran out frightened, so that his legs seemed
to give under him, same as a hop shoot that has no
stake, and he came home jabbering, crying, and laughing
like a frightened child, and nobody could do nought
with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BURBIDGE SEEKS HIS BROTHER</div>

<p class='c014'>“Farmer Benson, he tried to do what he could as
<i>maister</i>; but Benjamin had lost all respect, and laughed
at him same as if he had been his gossip. Nor could
any of his childers bring him to reason, neither Frank
nor Moses, his grown sons who live at Wolverhampton,
and have families of their own. So at last Mrs. Benson,
her has a-wrote to me, to come and try what I can do.
And seeing that Ben and I we be true brothers, and he
so down in his luck, I thought as I’d like to go and see
him, and look in at a Craven Arms bit of a show of a
few spring things, and so get a holiday and a sight of
poor Ben at the same time, if so be I can be free to-day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I assured Burbidge that he was quite free, as he
expressed it, and I trusted that he would find his brother
better than he expected. “Only make him believe that
Becky Smout is an impostor,” I said, “and has no real
power to injure him or his granddaughter, and all will
go well.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But at this advice Burbidge solemnly shook his
head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They ideas does for the Quality,” he grumbled,
“but workin’ folks know better. Us wouldn’t hold
such creeds if they warn’t deadly real.” And so saying,
my old friend clumped down the mediæval passage,
and I was left thinking how little Shropshire was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
changed, in spite of board schools and daily papers,
from the Shropshire of the Stuarts.</p>

<p class='c014'>A minute later and I heard a child’s voice close to
my elbow, and saw a little girl, Susie Rowe by name.
“You here, Susie?” I said, and asked the reason of her
visit.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was told “that grandam was but poorly,” and
Susie begged for a bit of tea and a drop of broth.
“Grandam doesn’t know,” added Susie, blushing, “for
her don’t hold to begging; but Betty Beaman, the old
body what lives with her, her says, ‘Hasten up, my maid,
and bring her something nice from the Abbey.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course,” I answered, “Mrs. Harley shall have
anything I have.” And I called to Auguste to fill the
basket with good things.</p>

<p class='c014'>He filled a little can with milk, got a packet of tea
and filled a gallipot with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crême de Volaille</span></i> from the
larder. Susie passed me a few minutes later, weighed
down by her basket, but all smiles, and she promised
she would tell her grandmother to expect a visit from
me in the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just before luncheon my little maiden appeared.
She was sad, and silent, and I did not allude to what
had taken place yesterday; but at luncheon-time I told
her I was going to Homer, and invited her to ride Jill
whilst I walked.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a lovely afternoon, sweet and almost warm,
but there was little sunshine. All was enveloped in a
soft grey mist. We walked along the lanes, Jill nosing
me at intervals for lumps of sugar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mouse was of the party, and ran backwards and
forwards very pleased and gay. A pony is always a
pleasure to a dog; it seems to give state and importance
to a walk. Tramp and Tartar scampered
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
ahead, and sniffed and skurried round, and up, and down
the high banks that skirted the track.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length we reached the lane that turns off from
the Wenlock Road, and Farley Dingle, and we stood
on the top of the edge before dipping down into the
valley to the little hamlet below known as Homer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BANISTER’S COPPICE</div>

<p class='c014'>I stopped to look at, and admire the view; even in
the subdued light of a grey winter’s day it was enchantingly
beautiful. The little cottages of Homer clustered
in a circle at my feet, whilst round them nestled orchards
of apple trees and damsons, which last would soon be out
in a mist of white blossom, like a maze of stars on a
frosty night. Far away I saw Harley church, the woods
of Belswardine, the smoke of Shrewsbury lying like a
mantle of vapour on the distant plain, and to the west
rose the great hills of Carodoc and the Long Mynde,
whilst immediately before me stretched the ill-fated
spot known as Banister’s Coppice.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was here, according to old tradition, that the
unfortunate Duke of Buckingham, in Richard III.’s
reign, was betrayed by his faithless steward at his house
at Shinewood. The story ran that the duke’s cause did
not prosper, and that his Welsh allies melted away, so
that he, finding himself hard pressed by the royal
forces, and not able to collect fresh troops, hurriedly
disbanded his followers and fled to the house of his
servant Banister, or Banaistre, as he was called by some
of the old chroniclers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Buckingham thought, having conferred great benefits
on his servant, that he could count upon his loyalty;
but Banister was tempted by the great reward, £1000,
offered by the king for his master’s apprehension, and
told “Master Mytton,” then sheriff, where he was
concealed.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
The duke, according to the old story, lay in a ditch
near the house, on the outskirts of the coppice, disguised,
it is said, in the smock of a countryman, and
was arrested at night by John Mytton, who came over
from the old hall at Shipton, with a force of armed men.
When Buckingham knew that his arrest was due to the
treachery of his servant, he broke forth and cursed his
faithless steward in the most awful, and terrible manner.
He cursed his goings in, and goings out, the air he
breathed, the liquor he drank, and the very bread he
ate, and with the same curse, he cursed all his family.
According to tradition, they all ended miserably.</p>

<p class='c014'>An old writer declares, “Shortly after Banister had
betrayed his master, his son and heir waxed mad, and
died in a boar’s stye; his eldest daughter, of excellent
beauty, was suddenly stricken of a foul leprosy; his
second son became very marvellously deformed in his
limbs, whilst his youngest son was drowned ‘and
strangled’ in a very small puddle of water. And Banister
himself, when he became of extreme old age, was found
guilty of a murder, and was only saved by the intervention
of the clergy, to whom he had paid large sums. As
for the £1000, the king,” says the same old writer, “gave
him not one farthing, saying ‘that a servant who had
been so untrue to so good a master, would be false to all
other.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Shinewood House—for the old manor of the duke’s
time has gone—I could not see, but I knew the place,
and as I looked across wood and meadow, all the old
story and its tragedy came back to me. Some
writers say that Buckingham was executed at Shrewsbury,
but Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More declare
that he was executed at Salisbury on the feast of All
Souls.</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT TO DONKEYLAND</div>

<p class='c014'>Bess and I walked down the cart-track and looked
below. Five or six donkeys were browsing on the scant
herbage, for every one at Homer keeps a donkey, and the
common name of the hamlet is Donkeyland. After a
few minutes’ walking, we left the main track, and
made our way to a little homestead that nestles close
against the hill, and is surrounded by a bower of fruit
trees. As we turned through the wicket a band of dark-eyed
children quitted the little school and greeted us.
The children looked as if they belonged to another race
than those at Much Wenlock. They had dark, almost
black eyes, and swarthy skins. I have been told that in
the end of the eighteenth century a gang of gipsies
came and settled at Homer, built huts for themselves,
married and settled there; and that is why the good
folks of Homer seem of a different race from the rest of
the neighbourhood. I paused before knocking at the
cottage door, and begged Fred, the groom who had
followed us, to take my little maiden for a ride, and
bring her back in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mayn’t I come in?” asked Bess.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not to-day, for Mrs. Harley is really ill,” I
answered. “Take the dogs, and come back presently.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess and her pony, followed by Tramp and Tartar,
vanished, and old Betty opened the cottage door. All
was irreproachably clean. The brass warming-pan over
the chimney piece shone like gold, and the old-fashioned
dresser was garnished with spotless blue and white
china. There was a mug or two of lustre-ware, a few
embroidered samplers on the walls, and a pot or two of
budding geraniums behind the windows. Upon the hob
a copper kettle hissed gaily.</p>

<p class='c014'>I asked after Mrs. Harley, the owner of the cottage.
But Betty shook her head. “She ’ave a-heard the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
Lord’s call,” she replied; “but she’s ready—been ready
this forty years, and her wants to go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A minute later I found myself by my old friend’s bedside.
She had a wonderful face, this old village woman.
Through it shone the inner light which once to see is
never to forget. I sat down by her, at a sign from
Betty, and asked her how she did.</p>

<p class='c014'>For all answer Mrs. Harley smiled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I fear you suffer?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That does not matter,” came back from her, “for
I am going home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The room was a plain little room with old oak beams
across the ceiling, the covering on the bed was old and
worn, there were only the barest necessities of life, and
yet as I sat watching my old friend, I could almost hear
the sound of angels’ wings.</p>

<p class='c014'>In spite of pain, long nights of sleeplessness, and a
long and weary illness, my old friend’s face glowed with
happiness, and in her eyes was that perfect look of
peace, which remains as a beacon to every pilgrim
who has ever met it. I offered to read to Mrs. Harley,
but she declined.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No readin’, dear, for I can hear Him myself.
There’s no need now to speak or pray, I’m goin’ Home.
I, what be so tired.” Then she thanked me for coming,
and asked me with an ethereal smile about “the little
one. Mak’ her grow up worth havin’,” she added
seriously. “Every child is made in the image of God,
and it isn’t parents as ought to deface His image.
’Tisn’t only book learning, and fine dressing, as will
make her a lady, but you’ll do yer best,” and she
patted my hand affectionately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO OLD FRIENDS</div>

<p class='c014'>Then my old friend began to talk of her past life, of
her early marriage, “fifty years agone,” with a right
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
God-fearing man; of her happy married life, and then,
calmly and bravely, of her joyous and approaching
death.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am going Home,” were her last words, and I
shall never forget the exquisite certainty of her tone, as
I left the room and followed Betty downstairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>A minute later, and Betty and I found ourselves in
the little kitchen below.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall miss her terrible,” she said in a husky
voice. “Nell and I, years and years agone, were
scholards together when old Madam Challoner taught in
the little white house yonder, afore the new school was
built. We growed up and we married, the same year.
Her got a good man; I got a beauty, and a bad one.
When Harley died, he left his missus the cottage,
garden, a few fields, and a tight bit of money. Soon
after her was left a widow, I went to see her, for Marnwood
Beaman, my man, he fell off a waggon, dead
drunk, and was killed, and I was left without a penny.
I couldn’t do much, for I had got cripply ever since I
had got the rheumatics, so I made up my mind it war
to the poor-house I war bound. One day (when I had
stomached a resolution to carry this through, and it
costs the poorest body a lot to do), I went, as I said,
to see Nell afore I spoke to the overseer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When I got in, Nell, her comed up to me and her
says, ‘What ails thee, Betty?’ for my eyes were red
and bulgy. Then I told her what war on my mind, and
that for all my cottage war a poor place, it went sadly
against the grain to leave it and to have a mistress to
knopple over me, and give me orders same as if I war a
little maid at school.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then,” added Betty, “Nell her brought me the
greatest peace as I have ever felt.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
“Her said, with one of her grand smiles, and sometimes,
for all her war but poor folk, Nell looked a born
duchess, but with a bit of an angel too, ‘Don’t you
think, Betty, of leaving and goin’ to the poor-house or
any other institution, but stay you at home with me.
Pick up your duds and us two will live together, for my
daughter be married.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘I don’t want exactly a serving wench, nor a daughter,
nor a sister, but some one as is betwixt and between,
and a bit of all three. Thee can work a bit, give thee
time, and we can crack an old tale together after tea; I
shan’t be timid with thee, nor thee of me. Us shall be
just two old folks goin’ down the hill together—and the
getting down shall be natural, and friendly. I can take
thy hand, and thou canst take mine.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“And her did give me a hand,” exclaimed old Betty,
warmly, “a hand that has kape me safe all these years;
and I bless the Lord for such a true and good friend.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We sat on in silence, and I could not but think how
sweet, and loyal, had been the friendship of these two old
people. Suddenly Betty got up and poked the fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Last time as yer war callin’,” she said, “yer asked
me, mam, what I could say about that Nanny Morgan,
her as war a known witch. Nell won’t name her, for her
says Nan was given up to the devil, and all his works,
and that her has something else to think of. But since
yer are wishful to know, and the little lady is not here,
I’ll tell yer what I can.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STORY OF THE WITCH</div>

<p class='c014'>“Nanny Morgan was the daughter of Richard
Williams, and she war born and bred in a little house
up at Westwood, on the way to Presthope. Yer must
often have seen the place, as yer go to Five Chimneys.
Nan war a fine, strapping lass when first I remembered
her. Dark, tall, with steel-grey eyes. Her got into
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
trouble when quite a maid for having a finger in the pie
of robbing Mrs. Powell at Bourton. Her was tried at
Shrewsbury for the robbery, and lay in prison, they said,
a long time. When her got out of prison her own people
wouldn’t harbour her, they said, and she went and lived
with the gipsies. There she learnt card tricks, tellin’ of
fortunes, and took to wandering and unchristian ways.
Us didn’t see her at Wenlock for a long while, but one
day she turned up at Wenlock Market on a Monday, and
told a friend that her had taken ‘dad’s old house’ and
meant to settle down and bide in the old place.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her called herself then Nanny Morgan, though who
Morgan war I never rightly knew, most like some tinker
man. Anyway, her went to Westwood, and there her
lived, told fortunes by cards and by hand-readin’, sold
love drinks, and was hired out as a curser—and of all
the cursers, there war none that could curse with Nan.
For her cursed the goin’s in and the goin’s out of folks,
the betwixt and between, the side-ways and slip-slaps,
till, as they said, there wasn’t foot-room for folks to
stand on, nor a thimbleful of air for a creature to
breathe, that hard could Nanny curse.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She was terrible to meet,” continued Betty. “Once
as I war walkin’ back to Homer after marketing at
Wenlock, I looked up and Nan was full in my road,
straight against the sky. How her had comed there, I
don’t know, but there her war, terrible fierce and sudden,
and her great eyes seemed to look through and through
me, and I fair quailed before her, as they say a partridge
does afore a hawk. Every one war feared of Nanny,”
added old Betty, “for they felt before her as innocent as
a child, and what war there as she couldn’t do to
them?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nan lived on at Westwood and none dared say her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
nay, or to refuse her ought, and all the while she went
on practising devil’s arts, till her got her death.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How was that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, it war years agone.” And Betty thought for a
moment and then added, “’Twas in the year 1857 that
Nan got her deserts.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There war a young lodger as had a bed at Nan’s,
and Nan took to him terrible, and the lovinger her got
the more he held back; and the witch played with ’um
same as a cat does with a mouse, and wouldn’t let ’un
off to marry his own sweetheart. So one evening, he went
into Wenlock, and he bought a knife, and he stole back
to her house, and she called him soft like a throstle.
Then while she stirred her pot, he stabbed her to get
free of her love philters. When Mr. Yates, who war
mace-bearer and barber, comed up, he found Nan, they
said, lying in a pool of blood, but they durst not undress
her for fear of getting witch’s blood, and we all know
that that is a special damnation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her led a bad life, did Nan,” pursued old Betty;
“her kept a swarm of cats, and one she called Hellblow
and another Satan’s Smile, and her had a box of
toads to work mysteries with, and these, they said,
would hop at night, and leer and talk familiar as spirits,
and besides these, there war a pack of wicked books. You
yourself, mam, have her card-table where her used to sit.
One leg of it higher than the rest, and the ledge below,
was where her wickedest toad used to perch—it as they
called ‘Dew,’ and that had been bred up on communion
bread, to reveal secrets. Sometimes, I’ve heard, Nan
would fall a-kissin’ that toad and whisper to it all sorts
of unclean spells. I couldn’t abear the table. It might
fall to speaking itself at nights, and then the devil only
knows what it would say.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
There was a pause, and then old Betty went on to
say—</p>

<p class='c014'>“After Nan war buried, the books one and all war
brought down to the Falcon’s Yard Inn and burnt
publicly. So that war her end, and a wickeder woman
never lived.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the sound of Betty’s last words died away, I
heard the noise of horses’ feet gaily trotting up the lane.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That will be my Bess,” I said, “and as the twilight
is beginning, I must return.” Then I begged that Susie
might come and tell me if there is anything I could send
for Mrs. Harley, and we passed out of the door.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST FLOWERS OF THE YEAR</div>

<p class='c014'>As we neared the wicket, Bess called out, “Look,
look, and see what I have found. Three snowdrops all
white, a hazel nut-tail, and a nice sticky bud of a horse-chestnut;
but never mind anything but the snowdrops,
for they bring luck, Nana says.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I took the first flowers of the year; what a dazzling
white they were! And I recalled, as I held them, the
old legend of the “white purification” as it was once
called.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And to think,” said Betty, smiling and noting our
joy over the flowers, “as I haven’t a blow to give my
pretty,” and she smiled at Bess; “but us has nought in
blow, save a bud or two of the damsons, and I dursn’t
pull it, for folks say, him as pulls fruit blossom deserves
the same as her as burns bread-crumbs, and I wouldn’t
bring her any ill-chance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I passed out of the little cottage precincts. I
saw old Betty still holding the gate, a dim figure with a
red shawl. Bess blew her a kiss, the dogs barked
furiously; even Mouse joined in her deep bell notes, and
once more we were under way on our own homeward
journey.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
A soft grey mist gathered round us, with the growing
darkness. All was very still after a few minutes, and
the only sound that we heard was the baying of a dog
in the distance at some lonely farm.</p>

<p class='c014'>Far away in the west gleamed a golden light. Once
we passed a brown figure of some labouring man returning
to his cottage, and as we neared a thicket of budding
blackthorn we were greeted by the voice of a throstle
singing his evening hymn. I carried my flowers reverently,
for were they not the first promise of spring, the
smile, as it were, of the scarce known year?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mum,” said Bess, as I lifted her off Jill’s back,
“could you spare me one of the snowdrops to keep in
my own nursery?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I nodded acquiescence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because,” pursued the child, “I should like one.
Just one. It would help me, I think, to keep away
eyes, and bad words, and perhaps might make me good
and happy. Nan says they used to bring in snowdrops
to make the children good, let me try, too.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The winds of heaven were blowing, blowing; dust was
flying on the roads. The old saying that “a peck is
worth a king’s ransom” returned to my mind. February
fill-dyke had filled the springs and the streams, and now
March with his gay sun, and wild winds was drying them
as hard as he could. How pleasant it was to see the sun
again! He had been almost a stranger in the cold dark
months of the young year. Yet early as it was, Phœbus
was proud and glorious and at his fiery darts all nature
seemed to begin and start life afresh.</p>

<p class='c014'>Man, beast, and bird, all felt the mysterious influence
of spring, whilst up the stems of all the trees and
plants, the sap began to mount again.</p>

<p class='c014'>I woke up early, but the world had already commenced
its work, golden rays of sunlight were pouring
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
into the windows and I found, too, that the restlessness
of nature had seized me also, so I went and peeped
out of an old chamber that commanded the eastern
garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>Outside, there was a sense of great awakening—the
sun flashed merrily down on the frosty turf, and the
congealed drops were already fast disappearing into the
ground. Starlings hurried, hither and thither, like
iridescent jewels, snowdrops lifted their heads and
waved them triumphantly in the breeze. The quice, as
Shropshire folk call wood-pigeons, I heard cooing in
their sweet persuasive note in a distant chestnut, and
as I fastened back the window the musical hum of
bees sporting in the crocuses, caught my ear.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the end of the border ascended the fragrance
of a clump of violets. How sweet is the return of spring,
I murmured, and how wonderful. What a joy, one of
the joys we can never grow tired of, or too old to feel
afresh each year. Winter seems so long, and the
awakening and sweet summer all too short.</p>

<p class='c014'>I returned to my room, dressed quickly, and then
went out into the garden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SONG OF BIRDS</div>

<p class='c014'>Life, life seemed everywhere. The wild birds were
singing, calling, flying backwards and forwards and seeking
food. The speckled storm-cock, as they call the missel
thrush in Shropshire, was singing gloriously on the top
branch of a gnarled apple tree, whilst from a bush of ribes
as I passed along, a frightened blackbird lumbered away
with his angry protesting rattle. How handsome he is, the
cock blackbird, with his plumage of raven hue, and his
golden dagger of a beak. In the twilight how irresistible
is the deep regret of his song. It is a song, sweet,
tender, full of old memories, and brings back in its subtle
melancholy, dear faces, and the touch of dear lost hands
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
that helped and loved us once. The blackbird’s note is
quite different from the thrush; the thrush’s song is all
pure joy, and glad expectation. He sings of morning,
and all his notes are in a major key. He chants of wholesome
work, of brave endeavour, and of spring gladness.
His rapture is like that of the early poets. No note
of sorrow dulls his glorious morning. Joy, health,
happiness, these are the keynotes of his rhapsody—and
we are grateful to him as we are grateful for the sunshine,
for the laughter of children, and for the scent of
flowers. It is hard to say which song we love best. But
why choose, for are not both God’s feathered choristers,
and their songs our earliest melodies of childhood?</p>

<p class='c014'>How feverishly busy everything was that morning,
and how seriously all living things took the annual
dawn of life. The birds on the lawns were pecking,
pecking everywhere, finding food and seeking materials
for the future homes of their young.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c014'>I stood quite still, against an ivied wall, and watched
an old thrush bring up a fat snail in her beak. In a
second she had cracked the shell upon a monastic stone,
and was feasting greedily on the contents. When she
had flown away, I examined the bits of broken shell,
and discovered that they were of a dull brownish
colour, and that the snail was one of the kind that the
Clugniac monks are said to have brought with them
from France, when Roger the great Earl of Montgomery,
brought over his band of monks from La Charité sur
Loire, and founded his monastery at Wenlock soon after
the Conquest.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the fourteenth and fifteenth century snails of this
kind, “Escargots” as they were then termed, and still
are called in France, were constantly used as a remedy
“for restoring a right motion of the heart, and for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
casting out melancholy.” A cure, it is said, was also
wrought by a “cunning jelly” made from them, and
this was supposed to be “proper” food for those who
“dwindered” or who were “subject to a weak, or
queasy stomach.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the fourteenth century, I have been told, snails
were sold at Bath and in other towns in the west, to such
as had consumptive tendencies. Knowing this, and
seeing how much escargots were used in the Middle
Ages, not only as a delicacy by the monks and nobles,
but also in medicine with herbs, presumably amongst
the poor, it is curious now, the horror that exists at
the thought of eating either snails or frogs. At first,
when I gave some dinners to the very needy, they
would hardly dare come for them, and declared that they
were sure that in Auguste’s ragouts there would be
found some lurking, somewhere.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Us doesn’t dare to search in the broth,” one old
man said, “for us doesn’t know what low beasts, slugs,
snails, tadpoles, and what not a foreigner mightn’t mix
in.” But now happily they are reassured, and old Ged
Bebb told me only last week, “That, for all that they
war heathan (the cook men), the meat war good, and
proper, and what Christian folks cud eat.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLOWERS OF TWILIGHT</div>

<p class='c014'>I passed into the old red-walled garden and stopped
to admire the long line of brilliant yellow crocuses.
They were all aglow in the brilliant sunlight, and stood
drawn up like a regiment of soldiers in line. I stood
entranced, for each soldier seemed to be holding a lamp,
and in each lamp, or cup, the sun was reflected in a
wonderful golden glory. It is hardly possible to exaggerate
the beauty of golden crocuses in golden sunlight.
They seem to fill the world with gladness and to be
March’s crowning glory. I stopped and looked at my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
clumps of crocuses, they were coming up gaily, but were
yet hardly in blossom.</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge put in for me strong clumps of Sir Walter
Scott, Rizzio, and of beautiful Mont Blanc. All these
were pushing up bravely, out of their mother earth. In
fact, they were bursting, as Bess calls it, to be out.</p>

<p class='c014'>A minute later, I turned to inspect my chionodoxas
and scillas. A few were coming into bloom. Luciliae
had several sprays of delicate china blue and white
flowers, and coppery two-blade leaves, and a patch of
blue <i>Scilla Sibirica</i> had reared already a spray or two of
gorgeous ultramarine blossoms; but it was still early
in March, and that is the time of the promise of beautiful
things, not yet the realization of Flora’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I went by a bush of white Daphne, I heard that
the bees had discovered this spring delight—they were
buzzing quite fiercely round its tiny flowerets. What a
perfume the Daphne has! What an enchantment of
rich odours! The pink bush on the other side of the
garden I noted would blossom shortly, but there is quite
ten days’ difference in the flowering of the two varieties.
The white follows “on the feet of snow,” as Burbidge
expresses it, and the pink, “when the spring has come.”
Of daffodils there was no sign as yet, save the little
hard green spikes, but the purple hellebores were proud
in their sombre magnificence. These always seem to
me flowers that might fitly have decked the brows of
some great enchantress, Morgan le Fay, or the Lady of
the Lake. They vary from green to darkest purple, and
they seem hardly flowers of gaiety or morning, but
rather the shadowy blooms of twilight. Unlike their
sister, the beautiful <i>Helleborus niger</i>, they will not live,
plucked, in water. When gathered, they fade almost
instantaneously and hang their heads in spite of salt or
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
charcoal being added to the water. I have heard it said
that if the stalks be cunningly split first, before being
put in water, that they will last some time; but I cannot
say I have ever found this plan successful, and have
come to the conclusion that if you want to see your
purple hellebores in beauty, you must go into the
garden to do so.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, as I walked on, I noted that the white arabis
was flowering in places. Such a dear, homely little
flower as it is, much loved by the bees who had
gathered to it like to a honey jar. As I stood watching
“the little brown people,” I heard the guttural click-click
of the little common wren. What a tiny little bird
she is, the Jenny Wren of the old nursery rhyme—“God
Almighty’s hen,” some of the old folk still call
her here. It is wonderful to think that so deep a note
can come out of so small a body.</p>

<p class='c014'>Jenny hopped about from twig to twig, gaily enough,
cocked her tail, and was, according to Burbidge, as
“nimble as ninepence.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEST IN THE KETTLE</div>

<p class='c014'>Here in Shropshire, in spite of the superstition that
she was under special Divine Providence, the wren was
often hunted at Yule-tide. Gangs of boys used formerly
to chase poor Jenny with sticks, in and out of hedgerows,
and over banks and stones. Particularly did this
ignoble sport take place on the sides of the Clee Hills,
and on the flanks of the Wrekin. Now, happily, the
time of persecution is past, and Jenny no longer suffers
ill from the hands of men. Hopping fearlessly near me
was the pet robin that I fed through the evil days of
snow and frost. How gorgeous he looked, with his
scarlet waistcoat, how sleek and plump; and how full
and liquid was his great brown eye. I begged Burbidge
to leave, as last year, the old iron kettle in the arbour
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
of honeysuckle, where he and Madam had their nest
and reared their offspring last spring. How tame she
was, with her little breast of yellowish brown and her
liquid great eyes that used to watch me so keenly when
I looked down upon her in the kettle. How patiently
she sat, and how sweetly he sang to her, amongst the
blossoms, his whole throat moving with his trilling
rapture. For two years he and “Madam Buttons” have
built in the kettle and brought up their nestlings there,
and preferred that site to a hole in bank or wall, branch
of tree, or to the thick shelter of the yews.</p>

<p class='c014'>The robin is looked upon in Shropshire as a sacred
bird. Folks here believe that some terrible calamity
will surely overtake him who robs a nest or kills “God’s
cock.” A poor woman once gravely told me that her
little son’s arm was withered, “be like,” she considered,
“that he had robbed a robin’s nest.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Him who slays a robin, may look to his special
damnation,” an old man once said to me, who had seen
what he termed a “gallous lad” throw a stone at one.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why thee cannot be content to rob the other birds,
and leave God Almighty’s fowls alone, I canna’ understand,”
was also an angry remark I once heard addressed
by a mother to a seven-year-old lad, and the
remark was followed by sharp correction with a hazel
switch. The old fear of, and reverence for the robin
comes doubtless from the legend that the robin
pricked his breast against the nails of the cross, and
ministered by song and devotion to the Divine Master
in His agony, and thus gained for himself and for all
his posterity the affection of God, and the gratitude of
man. In the old miracle plays the robin was often
spoken of as “God’s bird,” and this also may have
gained for him the love of many generations.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
I passed out of the wrought-iron gates, and went into
the meadows on the east side of the Abbey. The fields
lay brown still, and were as bare as a billiard-table.
They had been closely nipped by industrious sheep
during long winter months, and now there was but
little for the young life to feed on. Old, heavy, grey-faced
ewes were bleating and baaing, whilst skipping, capering
and leaping about were some eight or nine lambs. What
jocund games theirs were, what heights they jumped,
and with all four legs off the ground at once. As I
looked, I wondered what were the rules of the game, and
what impulse directed their sport; for there seemed to be
a leader in the revels, who ran and skipped first, after
which they all ran round, mounted an incline, descended
and mounted it afresh, cutting a hundred capers, and
playing a hundred pranks, but all according to some
old unwritten law and regulation. After a few moments
of watching the pretty little creatures, I made my way
to the old embankment which runs across the meadows
on the southern side, and which formed once the mighty
dam of the artificial lake from which the prior of
Wenlock drew up his fish in Lent and on special fast
days. There probably during the Middle Ages the lake
was well supplied with carp, eels, trout, and perch. Old
Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of Sopwell, near
St. Albans, wrote much and praised warmly the pleasures
of angling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If the sport fail,” she wrote, “at least the angler
hath his holsom walke, and may enjoy at his ease the
ayre and swete savoure of the medes of floures that
maketh him hungry and he may hear also the melodious
harmony of fowles.” She then goes on to say that he
can see also, thus happily employed, “the wild broods
of young swannes, heerons, duckes, cotes and all other
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
fowles,” and declares that a silent walk by stream or
lake in her eyes confers a greater and deeper happiness
upon the angler “than all the noyse of hounds,” than
“the blasts of hornes,” or “the wilde scrye that hunters
of fawkeners can make.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I like to think of the holy brothers fishing here in
their hours of recreation, after their vigils, fasts, and
prayers. As I walked along I saw the group of willows
that had turned crimson and brilliant amber, and far
away I heard the cawing of the rooks as they flew over
the plantation of poplars, which, too, were turning red.
I followed along the Abbot’s Walk, as the townspeople
term the dam, and then passed through a hunting gate
across a wild field of scrubby bushes and rough herbage
where the wild plover was uttering her melancholy cry
and wheeled in circles overhead. The mole-catcher had
been at work, a string of velvety moles hung like grapes
upon a thorn.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some years ago, “the ount catcher,” as he is called
here, old Peter Purslowe, appeared in a moleskin waistcoat.
Since then, however, he has never worn another.
“The missus,” I was told, “found it too weedy a job
ever to make a second, although it furnishes well, but it
had more stitches than ever there be stones at the
Abbey.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RETURN OF THE ROOKS</div>

<p class='c014'>I approached the rookery; what a babel greeted my
ears, yet if you have ever listened carefully you will
perceive that each rook has a different note of voice,
and I suspect, if you knew rooks individually, you would
notice, like in the songs of canaries, that no two rooks
ever caw precisely alike.</p>

<p class='c014'>What a wonderful thing it is, the return of the rooks
to any given place.</p>

<p class='c014'>For months they had been absent from this spot,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
gone nobody knows where. Not a sign of them. And
then, almost to a day, they reappeared, and claimed their
own tree and branch; and each pair, I fancy, went back
to the site of its former nest. Curious stories are told
of the sagacity of rooks, of their self-government, and
of how offenders who have disobeyed some common law
have been executed before large numbers, evidently as a
judgment, and as a warning to others.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I watched them, a story bearing out the truth of
this statement came back to me. In the rookery of a
friend there was hatched, I was told, a rook with white
wings. The community did not make any objection to
the youngster being reared there; but when, the following
year, the white-winged bird returned to an old
avenue of elms, where he had been hatched, exception
was taken to his desire to nest there. It seemed, said
my friend, as if a congress was called, and as if the
strangely marked rook and his mate were given the
option to fly elsewhere, or receive some dire punishment;
for at intervals they were chased away, but kept on
returning to the same spot. All day, rooks seemed,
said my informant, to flock to the avenue, till the air
seemed almost black with them. They flew, cawed
wildly, and seemed in a highly excited state. This
went on hour after hour, without any apparent change;
until at last one old bird descended from the branch on
which he had been perched, and standing on the grass,
flapped his wings slowly, uttering a strange, low, mysterious
cry, more like the husky croaking of a carrion
crow than the cawing of a rook. In a moment the
whole grove, said my informant, resounded with the
cries of the rooks, and one and all simultaneously fell
upon the unfortunate bird with the white wings, screaming
and cawing, and never rested until they had pecked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
him to death, and torn almost every feather out of his
helpless body.</p>

<p class='c014'>I recalled this curious story, and then watched the
birds as they flew round, finding sticks for their nests.
Ash sticks seemed to be their favourite material, or
twigs from the great wych-elm a field away.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rooks seemed, to quote a boyish expression, “to
build fair,” quite different from the mischievous jackdaws,
“who will allus rather thieve than work,” as an
old keeper once said to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is curious how rooks change their food during the
different months of the year. They feed their young
almost entirely on animal food till they leave the nest.
As a rule, they give the young rooks, grubs, worms and
cockchafers; but during the very dry summers that
closed the nineteenth century, being short of insect
food, the old birds took to robbing hen-coops, and fell
also upon young pheasants and partridges in the
grass. Several keepers have told me that they were
obliged to destroy whole rookeries on this account, for
when a rook once takes to chickens or pheasants, like
a man-eating tiger, he will never return to humbler
diet.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is wonderful how tenacious rooks are, of returning
year after year to the same place, and how difficult it is
for any one to start a new colony. Nests may be put
up, and young birds partially tamed, but it is a hard
matter, as a gardener once said to me, “to ’tice the
rooks against their will; ’tis like callin’ the wild geese,
unless they wish to hear.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROOKS LEAVE FOR A DEATH</div>

<p class='c014'>In the South there is a strong belief that when the
rooks abandon a rookery some misfortune will happen
to the owner. At Chilton Candover it is said, there was
much excitement because the rooks in Lady Ashburton’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
park unaccountably forsook their nests. Almost immediately
afterwards occurred Lady Ashburton’s death,
and many stories of a similar character are told.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I leant over the fence, watching what was going
on in the rookery, I heard a strange low cry in the
distance, as of something unearthly and eërie—what
Bess once said sounded like the “call-note of a witch.”
I remarked in the great black bird that came overhead,
a different flight, slower and heavier than that of a rook,
and I recognized in the bird approaching a carrion crow.</p>

<p class='c014'>I stood motionless. The rooks were too much occupied
with their building operations to notice the enemy, but
the peewits, who lay earlier in the meadow beyond, were
calling uneasily, uttering that strange cry of alarm
which is their special note of warning. On flew the
carrion crow, the bird of ill-omen in the old ballads and
a messenger of death according to old belief. Anyway,
if not quite so evil as he has been represented, the crow
is a bird that does great damage to keepers and farmers
and has few friends. As he flew away, I heard at
regular intervals, his creepy wicked cry.</p>

<p class='c014'>Old Shropshire folks still repeat to their grandchildren,
when they see a carrion crow—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dead ’orse, dead ’orse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where? Where?</div>
      <div class='line'>Prolly Moor. Prolly Moor.</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll come, we’ll come.</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s nought but bones.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In old days, Shropshire children used to imagine
that carrion crows flew off at night to Prolly Moor, there
to roost. Prolly Moor is a great tract of wild land that
lies at the foot of the Longmynd, and is said to be the
sleeping-ground of crows and the place where witches
hold midnight revels.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
I kept my eyes on the bird, and saw him sail away,
skirting in his flight the old town, and at last I noted
that he flew over the top of the Edge, at the back of
Wenlock Town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE IS A DREAM</div>

<p class='c014'>As I retraced my steps homewards, I was greeted
by the soft music of the chimes. How prettily they
sounded across the meadows; “Life is a dream, life is a
dream,” they seemed to say; yet for all their dreamy
sound I remembered that they are calling out the hour
of nine, and in spite of the joy of spring, the cry of
birds, and the charm of beast and flower, I hurried
up the stairs to the east garden and regained the
house.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the threshold of the east entrance to the Abbey
I met Bess.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mama,” she said reprovingly, “where have you
been? Your breakfast is getting cold, and it is to-day,
to-day I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The last part of Bess’s speech referred to the gift—the
present of all the presents, as my little girl called
it—which was to arrive; in other words, to the pug
puppy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Listen, mama,” she cried, “it is to come by the
train this afternoon; and Mamie has sent me a ribbon,
all blue,” and my little girl showed me a ribbon and a
letter announcing the fact in a childish round hand.
“Pups,” continued Bess, gravely, “cannot be dressed
in anything but blue. Then there is the day-bed to
discuss, his saucer and his supper plate—mamsie, there
is a great deal to do,” and Bess hurried me upstairs to
see the preparations.</p>

<p class='c014'>We found together a white saucer, and Bess looked
forward to washing it. But Nan said severely, “Best
let Liza, she understands such things.” And I feared,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
from the pursed-down corners of Nan’s mouth, poor
master pug would get but a scant welcome. Bess
noticed the expression on old Nana’s face and whispered,
“Specs God never gave Nan a dog-brother in
all her life.” Nan sat on stitching as if nothing could
move her from her seat, as she always does in moments
of irritation, and I must agree with Bess, that she was
neither kind nor helpful in her preparations for the
arrival of Prince Charming, as we christened our expected
visitor.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we left the room, Nan lifted her eyes from her
work, and said severely, “Might be a baby, I’m sure.”
We both felt rather chilled at this, and Bess took my
hand, and, while she jumped down two steps at a time,
asked if I didn’t think my own bedroom would be better
for the Prince than hers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One dog more, mamsie,” she urged, “couldn’t
make much difference. Where there’s place for Mouse,
mams, I am sure there is place for a pup.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But supposing Mouse objected?” I said. “What
a big mouth she has, and what sharp teeth, and what
a poor little thing the Prince would be in her jaws!
Besides,” I asserted, “I must introduce them carefully;
what if our old friend should be jealous or ‘unsympathetic’
like another old friend?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Whatever Mouse may be, she can never,” declared
Bess, “be real cross, like a real live woman. Dogs
aren’t made that way.” And so that part of the subject
dropped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCE CHARMING IS COME</div>

<p class='c014'>I went down to breakfast, and Bess sat by me talking
twelve by the dozen; her whole soul was engrossed
as to where the Prince’s day-basket was to be kept, and
whether the miniature blanket was to be tucked round
his infinitesimal serene highness—or not.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
As I got up from my breakfast, I saw to my dismay
that the post had brought me, what a friend calls, “an
avenging pile of letters.” How many hours’ writing they
meant, and other people’s work! Bess standing by cried,
“I wish they were all mine, I never get letters except
on my birthday, and at Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And never have to answer them,” I said. “Ah,
my dear, when one grows up, letters mean other things
besides invitations and presents. They can mean requests,
bothers, worries, other people’s work—and are
always sharp scissors for cutting up leisure, and preventing
happy hours in the garden or with one’s embroidery.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shouldn’t have them, then,” retorted Bess, stolidly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What would you do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Burn them and see what happened.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at Bess and laughed. After all, the idea
may be more “Philosophe qu’on ne pense.” But I was
not strong enough to carry her suggestion into action,
so I kissed Bess, told her I could not carry out her plan,
and said I must write all the morning, but hoped by
industry to save the afternoon for myself, and to spend
it as I wished.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last all the letters were answered—invitations,
requests, permissions, “characters,” money sent to charities,
and a great packet was assembled in the letter-box—then
when the last was finished, I called to Mouse,
and we wandered out together into the garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt that I had earned the pleasure of a free time
amid my birds and flowers. I walked along the kitchen
garden path and paused to enjoy that most excellent
and wholesome of all good smells, the odour of newly
upturned earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>To the south is a hedge of thorn some four feet high,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
and facing the same direction is a high wall where
apricots, peaches and pears are trained.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pears were all in blossom in dense sheets of
snow, and only tips of green were visible here and there.
To save the blooms from the frost, Burbidge had put
some tiffany in front of the trees, and fixed down the
coarse muslin-like stuff by laths of wood. There were
also cordons of pears running athwart the wall, and
over these to protect them he had put fir branches.
These pears are of the magnificent early dessert sorts
such as Clapp’s Favourite, Williams’ Bon Chrétien,
Souvenir de Congrès, and beside these we have the
earliest variety of all, the delicious little Citron des
Carmês, which often yields a dish of pears the first week
in August, before, so to speak, one has begun to realize
that summer is fleeting.</p>

<p class='c014'>On entering our little kitchen garden, there is a
hedge of roses on each side trained against some iron
rails. On one side ramps the delightful Gloire de Dijon
roses with all its many tinted blossoms of orange, creamy
white, and buff shades; on the other, is a hedge of the
superb old General Jacqueminot. The General is a
magnificent summer blossomer, he flowers in June even
in Shropshire, and his flowers are of the richest, fullest,
crimson, and of delicious sweetness—not as large as
many of the new hybrid perpetual sorts, but General
Jacqueminot’s rich red is of extreme beauty, and whatsoever
the season he always blossoms, and the scent is
one of the sweetest known. Then I paused to stop at
my bed of Ranunculi, a flower which once was held in
great favour by English gardeners, but which now
seldom finds a place in English <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterres</span></i>. Nothing
could be seen but a few little curly leaves like sprouting
parsley, but later I hoped for and expected a glory of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
colour. I grow all colours, crimson, vermilion, salmon,
pink, fawn, cherry and black, and some are of the darkest
shade of sumptuous orange.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VISIT TO CLUN</div>

<p class='c014'>These flowers are often found in old Italian Church
work, and I have read they were brought to Venice by
the Moors, and so introduced into Italy. I found Burbidge
waiting for me as I came up to him. He said he
was pleased to see me. I had not seen the old man in
the garden for some weeks. He had been ill since his
visit to Clun, and I had only seen him in bed, and then
in the presence of his old wife Hester—an austere
middle-aged woman “given to chapel ways,” as Burbidge
expresses it, so I had heard nothing fresh of Benjamin
or of his granddaughter Sal. After we had settled the
kinds of dahlias, and how best to sow the sweet-peas,
which last were to be sown in separate groups in lines,
I called my old gardener aside, away from “his boys” as
he calls them, although Roderick Pugh and Absolom
Preece are middle-aged men, and asked him in a whisper
about his visit to Clun.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was your brother better?” I asked. “Anyway,
tell me about them all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dahlias first,” said Burbidge shortly, and touched
his hat. And I felt there was not a moment to be wasted,
so we looked out a plot of ground that was suitable to
receive all the tubers, and then at last I got him away,
and to speak about his visit to his brother.</p>

<p class='c014'>Poor Sal——</p>

<p class='c014'>At first my old friend would not answer my questions,
and only looked grave, and shook his head. But at last
he yielded to my entreaties, and after calling out to his
boys to attend to their business and to do some “job”
in the far distance, he followed me into a secluded
path.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
“I would not for ever so much as them boys should
hear,” he began. “It might clean scare they, and
make ’em feckless about their spring digging and fettling;
but as yer have asked me, I’ll make a clean breast of the
business. I looked in at the show, but,” Burbidge
declared scornfully, “it warn’t nothing better than I’ve
seen scores of times in my own apple-room; and as to
the crocuses, hellebores and scillas, they wern’t nothing
but what us has, and better.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My old friend always enjoys speaking disparagingly of
shows and exhibitions, whatever he really thinks, for
even gardeners are not without some particle of envy, I
shrewdly suspect.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” continued Burbidge, “after business,” and
I knew business meant something connected with the
garden, “I went on to Clun, and there was a deal of
getting to get to Clun—stopping, waiting, and misinforming,
but at last the job got done. When yer
wants, yer gets, as Humphrey Kynaston said when he
made the leap.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Burbidge, but how about your brother?” I
said, trying to make him keep to his point.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I found him and Sal,” answered Burbidge, “strange
as bats in sunlight. They were both overlooked, sure
enough. Dazed and dimmy, same as if they had been
bashed and bummelled for a whole live-long week.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What did you do?” I inquired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I KNOW OF A CHARM</div>

<p class='c014'>“I just spoke,” was his reply. “But I couldn’t get
no answer. One and t’other, they looked like cats as
had been fair nicked by a blacksmith’s dog, and they
youped and trembled whensoever I spoke—and wouldn’t
answer, more than bats in a rick-yard. As to Sal, I
couldn’t get nothing out of she, save that a white dove
had flown again her bedroom winder, and had called out,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
‘Come, spirit, come;’ and as to brother Benjamin, he
nodded and spoke Dutch, he war that mazed and foolish,
and while he war taking on like, who should step inside
but his son Frank. And Frank he come in bold as a
lion, and trim as a dandy with a bobbish tie, and he said,
‘Here be Malachi, him as was born under this roof when
my missus war took worse all of a sudden. He be a tall
young fellow, hale, hearty, and fresh as a May sprig.
He have joined the volunteers, and has at home his
uniform, which be next best to a general’s.’ And when
brother Ben heard him, he fair burst out in a rage.
‘What matters it,’ he saith, ‘what generals, or kings,
or thy sons clothe themselves in, or who has beef or
beer when <em>I</em> sits in mortal fear;’ and he shivered and
quailed same as a poor body in a Poorhouse as hasn’t
nought of his own, not so much as his own pipe or the
shirt to his back. And while father and son were talking,
Malachi he comed up, and he said, smiling like an April
day, ‘Never you fear, grandad, for all I’m young, I know
of a charm as ’ull free you from all her hanky-panky
ways.’ And then, without a word from his grandad, he
kind of touched his stick as if he war touchin’ a pretty
wench as he war keeping company with, and he started
whistlin’ an old tune, and he called out over his shoulder,
‘I’ll cure ye,’ and laughed as one who has a joke all to
hisself, and so out went Malachi.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then there was quiet for a bit, and I heard naught
but a crying of the wind outside; but suddenly voices got
introduced, and we heard a crying and a calling and a
scuffling in the garden, or thereabouts, loud as the cry of
the Seven Whistlers; and I sat quiet till I could stand
no more, then I peered out, and there, sure enough, war
Malachi and the witch.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And Malachi, he called out, ‘Down on yer knees,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
yer old hathan, or I’ll beat yer—old witch as yer call
yerself—black and blue if yer don’t stir yer old tongue
and say arter me, “I hain’t got no magic, nor no charms
neither, I be a born fool, and I swear I’ll leave Benjamin
Burbidge and his granddaughter for ever more alone.”’</p>

<p class='c014'>“And the witch,” continued old Thomas, “her did
swear it. ‘So help me God, I will,’ her cried out; and
her spoke as true as Gospel truth, for I think her meant
it, for as Malachi said, ’tis wonderful, even with a witch,
the magic of a stout ash-plant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge’s words still rung in my ears when running
up the garden path I saw my little maiden approaching
me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We shall be late,” she cried excitedly, “if you don’t
come at once—at once, I say. And think what a terrible
thing it would be to keep Prince Charming waiting.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I nodded to Burbidge and started off with Bess at a
brisk trot up the front drive, mounted the field that led
to the station, and waited panting on the platform for
the little dog.</p>

<p class='c014'>To my surprise Bess had a cloak on her arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are not cold, child?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no, mum; but what if the pug was to catch
cold?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We must hope not, for that would be a calamity,”
I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess skipped and danced up and down, clinging to
my hand, jumping and swaying backwards and forwards,
as if her little body were made of quicksilver. Then,
after a while, she suddenly fell into a reflective mood, and
asked what are the best ways of forgetting that you are
waiting?</p>

<p class='c014'>“To think of something else, or not to want so
badly,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
“I couldn’t do that,” answered Bess, gravely, “because
I shouldn’t be me if I did, and he couldn’t be
Prince Charming if I didn’t want him. I feel,” she
gasped, “as if I just want, want till I am dying of
wanting.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at my little girl. “Suppose he didn’t come
by this train, what would you do then?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know. Go to bed, I think, and cry.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRINCE ARRIVES</div>

<p class='c014'>But happily there was no need of so sad an ending
to a bright spring day, for as I spoke the train rushed
in. The porter hurried forward, and there was a general
commotion. Two passengers got out, a couple of old
fowls were removed, and a second later, a little basket
also was taken out of the luggage-van.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shall I have this sent to the Abbey?” inquired
the station-master.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Bess would not hear of so slow a manner of
getting the pug-puppy down. In delirious joy the little
mantle was flung on the ground and her arms were
tightly clasped round the basket. When one has been
sent a pug-pup there is only one place to go to—home.</p>

<p class='c014'>So I picked up the mantle, and Bess, bearing her
cherished possession, led the way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then there was tea, which, as we have no bells, Bess
saw to herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>I heard her in the passage giving a hundred contradictory
orders. It is to come at once, and then,
there’s to be broth for the puppy and cakes, “sponge
and the other, and meat,” and at last she returned
breathless to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have ordered everything,” she cried, and took the
little dog off my knee. It was a sweet little baby dog
with a crinkly-crankly black phiz and dear little blinking,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
cloudy blue eyes. The ribbon that was sent to adorn
his neck was much too big to fasten round his throat,
but he looked contented and rested drowsily under
Bess’s continued protestations of affection.</p>

<p class='c014'>After tea we sat on before the chapel hall fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thought last Christmas,” said Bess, “when I had
the white bride doll, that I never should want nothing
no more. But now that I have the pug Prince, I know
I shall never want anything again, not if I live to be a
hundred.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait till the next time,” I laughed. At that
moment I heard a scratching at the study door, which
opens upon the chapel hall. I opened it and took
Mouse gently by the collar.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bess,” I said, while I held on tightly, “the introduction
must be made, but with tact,” and I and Mouse
returned together.</p>

<p class='c014'>I put the puppy on the rug. Mouse looked at it
sadly and then walked severely away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why does she behave like that?” asked Bess.
“See, Mouse is whining and wants to go out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is jealous,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why should she mind?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Think, Bess,” I replied, “what would you say if
there came here a new baby, a new helpless little thing.
Might it not be just a little bit of a trial to you, don’t
you think, when you saw all the world running about to
welcome it, cake, tea, milk, cream, all ordered for it at
once? We none of us like being put in the shade, not
even Mouse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess looked at me, and then putting the pug down,
she cast her arms effusively round the great hound’s
neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must forgive my little pup,” she said coaxingly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
“and not hate presents, even if they are for other
people,” and a shower of kisses followed.</p>

<p class='le-caption'><i>Photos by Miss Gaskell.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>Mouse was mollified; she looked at me gravely. He
has not the first place, she seemed to say, and she
came and laid her great head solemnly on my knees.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She knows,” said Bess, “that not even Prince
Charming can put her nose out of joint.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mouse watched the little pug out of the corner of
her eye, but with more sadness than malice. Bess fed
her with slices of cake, whilst the pug approached her
future gigantic companion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All friends now,” Bess whispered. “Nobody now
to get nice but Nana; but nurses always take longer to
forgive than dogs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NANA IS KIND</div>

<p class='c014'>In the evening I stole upstairs and found Prince
Charming sleeping in his little basket by Bess’s bed.
Apparently old Nana had yielded to his charms, or
else was reconciled to his having a nursery existence.</p>

<p class='c014'>She got up from her sewing and said with a smile
on her good old face, “Bless her little heart, how it
do please her, the pup; but then she must have what
she has a mind to.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After this, I had a quiet hour with my books, and I
took down for the last half-hour a volume of Montaigne.
What delightful company he is, always bright and
cheery, full of knowledge, and yet always so human.
I came to the passage which Madame de Sévigné always
said brought tears to her eyes. I refer to the “affection
of the Mareschal de Montluc for his son who died in
the island of Madeira.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My poor boy,” wrote the Mareschal, “never saw
me with other than a stern and disdainful countenance,
and now he is gone in the belief that I neither knew
how to love him, nor esteemed him according to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
deserts,” and the remorse and pity of it all. In the
silence of the night it all came home to me. What a
touching picture it is, the reserved old man with no
word of love on his tongue, and yet his heart full of
affection. “For whom,” cries the grief-stricken old
man, “did I reserve the discovery of that singular
affection that I had for him in my soul?” What a
pathetic tale it is, one of Montaigne’s many. What a
homely tongue the great essayist has, and yet what a
wise one—possessing, as he does, the art of telling us
all the old tales of Greece and Rome clothed in summer
verdure, so that the leaves of his discourse never grow
stale or faded. He makes the ancient world live again,
and gives men and women who lived and died hundreds
of years before he was born new life and beauty.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, do not let us love in vain. Let us find out
our love before the wave has gone over the dear one’s
head,” is what I seemed to hear. “Do not let our lips
call in the coming time, ‘Lord, too late, too late!’”</p>

<p class='c014'>I thought of little Bess, the happy owner of her dog,
and I said, at least, Lord, my little maid will look back
on her childhood, I hope, as a happy, happy time, a
time of flowers, and joyous play. Bad times must come,
but let me be a happy parent in that I have given my
child no more unhappy time than I could help!</p>

<p class='c014'>The next morning. I sauntered off into the garden.
There were the gladioli to plant, so that they might
blossom well before the autumn frosts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLOWERS IN A GARDEN</div>

<p class='c014'>First of all, come the beautiful early summer sorts
such as the delicate Bride, Leonora, Mathilde, and
Colvilli, and then in autumn the brilliant Brenchleyensis,
Gandavensis, and exquisite soft tinted Lemoinei. Burbidge
has a pocket-book in which the date of all plantings
as well as sowings are registered. “Them gladiolouses,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
as he calls them, “war put in the 4th of March last
year, so they this year must be put in their places
without delay in the red-walled garden to enliven the
borders, and there must be a large patch in the kitchen
garden for pulling” (picking), for Burbidge, in common
with most gardeners, cannot bear picking his blossoms
in the real flower garden. Blows for the garden is the
old man’s constant adage, and he will sometimes say
sourly, “What for do ladies want their places littered
about with jars and tubs and what not, same as if their
chambers was fresh-blown meads? Let ’em be, say I,
where the hand of the Lord hath put ’em.” And he will
add, “growing blows is right, ’cause it is in the way of
nature, but I don’t hold to parlour bowers. They be
unwholesome, not to say a bit retchy.” I am inclined
to agree with my old friend in some of his strictures
about the modern drawing-room, for a room laden with
scents, and that has closed windows, is certainly a
productive source of headaches.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I stood by the garden watching Burbidge and
his men plant the gladioli, a little figure dashed up to
me. “Mama,” cried Bess, in a state of wild excitement,
“they’ve come, two real princes, I really do
believe.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was puzzled for a moment, but at last I stammered
out, “Where? Where?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“At the pond, at the pond,” exclaimed Bess,
trembling with delight.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not get anything more out of Bess, but
Burbidge, hearing her mention the pond, hobbled up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bless her little heart!” he said, “the little lady
means the swans.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And in answer to my inquiry, “What swans?”
he answered—</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
“Didn’t yer hear, mam, about the great birds?
No?” Then he went on to tell me how, in the early
morning, when he and the under-gardeners “war fettling
up on the east side between six and seven, us suddenly
heard a kind of unearthly crying, like some one
moaning and sobbing, and whispering right up aloft.
And then,” continued my old friend, “I seed such a
sight as I’ve never seen afore. Fowls as big as chest
o’ drawers flyin’ round and round. They came on flying
in great circles, as if they couldn’t stop, till down they
flumped like a couple of cannon balls, and struck slap
into the great Abbey pool.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did,” pursued Burbidge, “tell Miss Célestine
later to let yer know, seeing as you be interested in
all fur and fluff, birds and insects, and most varmint,
but her have no sense, save for frills and furbelows.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On hearing of the arrival of the swans, I seized
hold of Bess’s hand, and off we went together to welcome
our new visitors.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were beautiful white birds of spotless plumage,
probably driven from the lake of Willey, or from further
off, by the cruelty of their parents. For old swans
become terribly fierce as the nesting season comes on,
and will not even allow the offspring of a past spring to
remain on their own waters.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How lovely they are,” said Bess, enthusiastically.
“It is a real fairy-story, mamsie, this time.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUSE FEEDS ON BREAD</div>

<p class='c014'>Then we returned to the Abbey, and brought out a
basket of broken scraps. Bess threw some pieces into
the water, and the swans stooped down their beautiful
graceful necks and fed with avidity. Bess watched
them intently, whilst Mouse, who had followed us too,
looked on superciliously; and then, with great greediness,
ate all the bread that she could reach, so that, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
Bess said, “too much food should not be wasted on
mere swans.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t she greedy?” cried Bess. “At home she
hardly eats even cake!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Poor old Mouse! She is made up of unamiable
vices, excepting to us. Then Nana appeared, and declared
crossly that my little girl would catch her death
of cold standing on the damp grass by the water.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess fired up at this and retorted, “As if, Nana,
people ever catch cold when they watch swans. Why,
my mother watches birds hundreds of hours, and she
never catches cold.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But, in spite of Bess’s protestations, my little maid
was carried off by Nan, who, I heard, afterwards went
off to the post-office to get a postal order.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Bess returned from her short turn, I noticed
that she was grave and silent, and not at all the usual
bouncing Bess of Wenlock, as we are wont to call her.
I mentioned that I was going for a longer walk, in
search of white violets, and begged her to come with me,
if she was not too tired, and bring a basket in case we
found any.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first I thought Bess’s reluctance sprang from the
fact that Prince Charming would have to be left at the
Abbey, although I assured her that Auguste would fully
console the Prince for our absence; but say what I would,
Bess seemed out of spirits. And so, before we started,
I sat down on a bench and asked my little girl, who
looked worried, if she was not feeling well.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” answered Bess, “only, only——” And then
I found out the truth. “When Nan and I were walking
in the town,” Bess explained, “Mr. James, Hals’ father’s
coachman, came into the chemist’s shop and told us
that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> was dreadful bad, tumbled down and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
broke her leg, he said. He laughed and said it was a
judgment for being <em>that nasty</em> to Master Harry. But
oh, mama, could it—could it really be?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, Bess,” I answered quickly, “don’t think that
for a moment. You were very naughty, and very silly,
but then you are only a little child, and you did not
know what you said, or understood what you meant.
Beside,” I said rather grandly, to get over the difficulty,
“God has other work than to attend to the idle words
of a little child. So dry your eyes, dear, and be a happy
little person again. Run upstairs and fetch a basket,
and we will go off together.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Bess shook her head. “I will be a happy little
girl,” she said, “but I’d rather not go all the same,”
and she left me.</p>

<p class='c014'>So I started off alone with Mouse, who, nothing loth,
followed me gladly on my expedition.</p>

<p class='c014'>We all have favourite flowers, or imagine that we
have, probably owing to some early association or to
some tender recollection. Queen Bess is said to have
best loved meadow-sweet, with which her chambers
were strewn. The great Condé, they say, was devoted
to pinks; and Marie Antoinette is said to have loved
sweet rocket, bunches of which were brought her by
Madame Richard to the Temple.</p>

<p class='c014'>I called to mind these favourite blossoms, but my
floral love is not of the garden, it has no place in tended
borders. I love it even better than the choicest rose, or
the most brilliant gladiolus, or the most stately lily. It
grows amongst the hedgerows of Shropshire, and is
known as the wild white violet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FLOWERS OF SPRING</div>

<p class='c014'>Its scent is sweet but often elusive, and as evanescent
as a beautiful smile. Our highly cultivated borders
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterres</span></i> are beautiful, but our wild carpets in field
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
and wood more beautiful. Wild flowers come amidst
the grass, and blossom at their own sweet will in their
own sweet place, and the moor, meadow, or coppice
make the most enchanting background for their loveliness.</p>

<p class='c014'>I wandered along the green paths with hedgerows
starting into life, and came to the conclusion that the
flowers we each love best are the homely flowers of
childhood that we played by, and plucked as children.
The dog-rose, the violet, or the primrose, whose leaves
we know the inside and the outside of, whose stalks we
have handled a hundred times, and whose scents recall
dear faces, and gentle memories, that go back to long
ago.</p>

<p class='c014'>I walked along, Mouse following dutifully behind me.
The hedgerows were full of green curls and twists,
groups of wild arums glittered on the banks below hazel
and quickset hedges. Here and there little patches of
grass had burst into emerald green, and a few daisies
were turning their discs to heaven, whilst in sheltered
spots dim primroses were dawning shyly on the world,
filling the atmosphere with sweet dalliance and dreaminess.
Once, as I wandered along, I saw behind a cottage
in a lane a mauve carpet of periwinkles, and once,
beneath a chestnut, I saw the glitter of golden king-cups,
that Wordsworth loved so well. The afternoon
was very fair, purple and golden lights flitted round the
hills and rested on the freshly ploughed hillsides;
“longer days and sunshine,” the thrushes seemed to
sing, and I heard them piping exultantly in every
orchard as I passed. I went by the Red Marsh Farm,
past the old mullion-windowed barn, which is said to
have been a chapel in monkish days, and so across the
close-nipped fields to Sherlot Forest. I walked by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
patch of gorse all ablaze with golden blossoms. Tiny
young rabbits dashed under cover, showing their white
scuts. My great hound lumbered after them like a
luggage train in mad career; but nothing happened—they
vanished like lightning, and Mouse joined me panting
at the hunting gate below. As I whistled her into
heel, I noticed that the honeysuckles in the hedgerow
were clothing themselves in silvery green, and that a
willow by a pool was bursting into golden glory. The
earth was dry and I could not resist sitting down for a
moment. A squirrel dashed up an oak and scolded and
chattered, Mouse, seeing him, growled angrily; a greenfinch
flew from out of a thicket, giving me a beautiful
vision of apple-green wings; whilst in the distance I
heard, far off, the note of a distant blackbird singing a
song of regret and tender longing. How enchantingly
lovely all was, and on all sides no sounds but country
ones.</p>

<p class='c014'>I peeped over the hedge, men were ploughing and
sowing the grain, and away to the west I heard a boy
whistling a few notes of a half-forgotten tune. What
was the tune, I wondered.</p>

<p class='c014'>How few folks whistle or sing now; the time was
when everybody “sang a bit,” as Burbidge calls it, to
their work—men in the hayfields, women at the washtub.
Was the world, when it sang at its work, a
happier or jollier world? I asked myself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“HEAVEN’S HIGH MESSENGER”</div>

<p class='c014'>I passed over a stile and walked across a clover field.
How prosperous it looked, how green after the seared
and sad appearance of permanent pasture, which still lay
brown and lifeless. Overhead the bravest of all West-country
songsters was singing—the skylark. What a
speck he appeared throbbing in the sky, only a little
dot hardly bigger than a pin’s head; but what a voice he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
had, what a cry of exultant joy was his, what a melody
of passion, what a glory of triumphant music! I stood
and listened like the poet, and wondered how a bird
could sing so; such joy, such passionate melody seemed
superhuman, and how the notes were produced in the
tiny throat was then and will always remain a mystery.
He did not seem a living, breathing bird; only a voice—a
voice of incarnate joy and gladness. Silver hammers
seemed to throb within him and to beat out a prayer of
ecstatic joy, which no heart could measure, and no human
tongue pronounce. Then suddenly, as a leaf, he fell,
and the exquisite singer of a moment before became
again only the little brown bird, a dweller amongst
green fields, and a familiar of everyday life. Yet for
all that we, too, dwell on earth and toil and spin, it is
well to have heard the music of heaven. I walked along
refreshed and gladdened, for in spite of the shadows
that envelope us, “there burns in each an invisible
sun,” and amid such scenes it is impossible not to feel
a passing ray.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last I reached the well-known bank. A few shy
violets were in blossom—the afternoon sun was playing
upon the opening blossoms. I picked two or three tiny
flowers, but only a few, for I like to leave a spot as fair
as I found it, and the little petals were still tightly
curled. Growing close to the violet was another charming
woodland flower, the wood-sorrel, or witches’ cheeses
as village children often call it here. The little blossoms
were of an exquisite translucent white, with delicate
lavender veins, and strange triangular leaves that folded
up at night like the leaves of a sensitive plant.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some people say that the wood-sorrel is the true
shamrock used by St. Patrick to illustrate the doctrine
of the Trinity. Be this as it may, it is a delightful
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
little plant, and one of the most charming inhabitants
of our English woods.</p>

<p class='c014'>Its veined delicate petals recalled to me the form and
beauty of the exquisite grass of Parnassus, which I have
often discovered on the moors of the west coast of
Scotland and in a few spots in the wildest parts of the
Shropshire hills. A little further on, I came to a patch
under a hazel tree of bronze leaves. These I recognized
to be the leaves of the ground ivy, and its minute
mauve blossoms were just coming into blossom. This
plant used to be called ales-hoof, and was formerly put
into beer as a flavouring, much in the same manner as
we put borage now into claret cup, or introduce into
badminton a peach, or a spray of nettles. From the
ground ivy an excellent tea can be made which possesses
purifying qualities for the blood, and which was formerly
much used in Shropshire as a spring tonic. Tea from a
decoction of nettles is also constantly drunk in Shropshire,
as is also a drink made from wild mallows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BREATH OF SPRING</div>

<p class='c014'>As I retraced my steps the light was fast fading, and
the gold turning into lavender. All was dying, the
reds and golds turning into sombre browns and greys.
Flowers were falling asleep, and far away I saw a line
of cattle gently driven to some far farm-steading. As I
walked across the meadows, I noted that the little lambs
had crept to their dams’ sides, and meant to remain
there quiet and snug till the small hours of the morning.
Alone in the dusk I caught here and there the triumphant
song of the throstle; all else was still. In the
gloaming I saw dimly brown figures crossing upland
and valley to the lonely hamlets that nestled amongst a
starry mist of damson groves. The bright March day
of work and gaiety was over. Frost might visit the
earth in the night, but to-morrow, judging by the red
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
sunset, would be another day of gladness and hope and
brightness. I told myself spring had come, and that
soon all our dear feathered friends would return. The
nightingales would sing in the south, in every hazel
coppice, and in the dusky groves of twilight, whilst all
over England swallows would fly, near smoky towns and
over lonely meres and rivers alike, carrying the message
that sovereign summer was at hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I returned to the Abbey, I found that Bess was
in bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She be asleep,” nurse said, “but she seemed wonderful
busy about something, all in a flurry like, and
didn’t take no notice, not even of the pug; but her
would say her prayers twice over. And when I asked
why for? She answered it war best so, for the Lord
somehow would make her happy, even if she had to
pray twice over for a blessing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then old Nana went on to say, “This afternoon,
Miss Bess went out with Liza after you left, and as
they comed in they was whispering together. I don’t
hold with slyness,” and old Nana pursed up her mouth,
and I felt, as the French say, that Liza would have
at some future time a bad quarter of an hour, and that
a storm was brewing in the domestic cup. I didn’t,
however, ask for an explanation, but waited for the
morrow to reveal the acts of to-day.</p>

<p class='c014'>I walked downstairs and sat down before my writing-table,
and wrote a long letter to a sister. What a comfortable
relationship is that of a sister, a very armchair
of affection, for with a sister no explanations are necessary.
Then there is nothing too small to tell a sister.
Worries, pleasures, little heartaches, all may find their
way on paper, and not appear foolish or ill-placed. So I
wrote away gaily, a little about flowers, books, garden,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
embroidery, cuisine, a little domestic worry, and I
wound up with a quotation.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I was folding up my letter, I suddenly heard a
knock at the door. “Come in,” I cried, and I saw
Liza at the door, candle in hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Bess is all right?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes, mam; but I thought I should like you to
know——”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Liza went on to say that nurse had taken
on terribly, and was all of a stew because she had let
Miss Bess spend her money as she had wished this
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Bess,” continued Eliza, “would have it so,
and wouldn’t take no refusal; and, as Mrs. Milner was
out at tea with Mrs. Burbidge, I had to let the child do
as she had a mind to.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what happened?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I hardly know,” replied Eliza. “We went to
——” mentioning a shop—“but there Miss Bess wouldn’t
on no account that I or Mdlle. Célestine should come
in. She called out, ‘Stay outside till I have done.’ So
Mademoiselle and I we walked outside up and down till
we was fit to drop, and then, I do assure you, mam,”
added Eliza, “I knew nothing till I saw Miss Bess come
out with a small parcel, which she held very tight and
wouldn’t give up to nobody, and then I seed as it was
directed in Mr. Burbidge’s handwriting—that is to say,
there was a label; and we sent off the package, and I
paid twopence in stamps for doing so, but Miss Bess
wouldn’t tell me, ask her as much as I would, who it
was for. Mademoiselle tried hard to make Miss Bess
tell, but she couldn’t get nothing out of her, although
she caught hold of her; but Mr. James, the butcher’s
boy, coming up, Mademoiselle let Miss Bess be, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
so we went home; and I didn’t think much about it
till I looked into Miss Bess’s purse to-night to see what
she had spent, and then I saw there wasn’t one penny
left, and she must, I fear, have spent it all on the
packet. It’s only right, mam, as you should know,“
pursued Liza, flushing crimson, ”lest Mrs. Milner should
say that I had taken some, for just now Mrs. Milner
be quite furious, fussing round and saying that Miss
Bess has been fair robbed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never mind,” I said, “when I see Miss Bess in
the morning I will go into the matter, and find out how
she spent her money.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I wondered, as I sat down and began to embroider
after folding up my letter, what would be the explanation
of the mystery. Probably, I said to myself, a little
present to Harry, for Bess is a very generous little soul,
and most of her pocket-money is spent in gifts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NANA IS ANGRY</div>

<p class='c014'>The next morning my old nurse, holding tightly
Bess’s hand, came downstairs just as I had finished
breakfast. She looked, as Burbidge would say, “black as
tempest,” and I didn’t envy Eliza’s place in the nursery.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Bess will tell you,” she said, “and as for Liza,
I think it a most disgraceful affair to have let the poor
lamb spend her money as she and Mademoiselle did, and
never so much as to turn their heads back. Pack of
fools talkin’ to passers-by whilst the poor child was bein’
robbed. That’s what I call ’em.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wasn’t,” cried Bess, stoutly. “It was my own
money and my own fault. I paid it all myself, and I
won’t tell nobody about it but mama.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Old Nana took no notice of this outburst, and vowed
that she would get the money back somehow, and let
everybody know what she really thought of ’em. I said
nothing, for the fat was in the fire, and the one thing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
that I am sure of was, that you couldn’t change anybody’s
determination of over seventy; and what Nana
determines to do, Nana will do, for all the king’s horses
and all the king’s men. When Bess and I were alone,
I turned to Bess. “Tell me, little girl,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess answered, “Oh, mama, I know it is all right.
Nana’s very old, but she couldn’t get it out of me. I
mean to tell nobody but you and Hals, for a secret is a
secret.” And she added irrelevantly, “I couldn’t walk
with you because I felt I must do it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, dear?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Making it up with God</em>,” replied Bess, but quite
reverently. “When I heard that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> had broken
her leg, I knew that something must be done, for, for all
you said, mamsie, I couldn’t help feeling that my curse
might have done something; not,” explained Bess,
“exactly made <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> break her leg, but it might
have made it easier for her to do so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, dear, but tell me what you did.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you know, mamsie,” answered Bess. “I went
off for a walk with Liza and Célestine, but first of all I
slipped upstairs when nobody was looking and got my
purse. I didn’t quite know what I had, for I didn’t
stop to count the money inside, but there were three
silver bits and four copper monies.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When I got into Mr. ——’s shop,” pursued Bess,
“I said I wanted something that would be a comfort
to somebody who had broken their leg. And he said,
‘Certainly, Miss, I have just what you want.’ And he
gave me a little leather case painted all over with pink
and blue flowers, quite pretty, though not quite like any
flowers that I know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Bess,” I said, and took little Bess’s hand
encouragingly.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GIFT FROM BESS</div>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” said Bess, “I don’t rightly understand
monies, so I told Mr. —— to take out what he wanted.
But he said there wasn’t quite enough; so I said I
would bring the rest next Saturday, when I got paid
up for my good-conduct marks, if it wasn’t very much.
And he said, ‘Don’t mention it, miss, only sixpence
more.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“So, then,” pursued Bess, “he did up the little
packet, and if a shopman does not know what is good
for a person with a broken leg, who should, I should like
to know,” and Bess looked round her triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then my little maid went on to say, “I stuck on
the label that Burbidge wrote for me, and that he did
for me in the tool-house when we two were alone; but
he put Miss, not <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>, as we neither of us knew
how to spell it. But we wrote governess below, and
Roderick, who, Burbidge says, is a scholar, put in ‘<em>her</em>
with the broken leg,’ so they were sure to understand.
And then Mr. —— stuck it with his tongue—for it was
all gummy—and I and he pressed it down tight, and
then Liza and I carried it off to the post-office, and that
is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Bess added, with a catch in her throat, “I
haven’t been wicked this time. Nana says it’s wicked to
spend my money without telling you; but I say I must
<em>pay off</em> God, for I want to be happy as princes and
princesses are happy in fairy-stories.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess’s attitude of mind was a little difficult to follow,
as is often the case with children; but as I felt that
the whole funny little business had sprung more from
childish kindness than anything else, all I did was to
kiss my little maid and say, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> will be pleased.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess left me beaming. “My mama,” I heard her
say later to her old nurse, “says there is no harm in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
what I did; and that I may give cigarette-cases or whatever
I like to governesses who break their legs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Two days later Miss Weldon received a letter from
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> Schlieman, returning the case, and saying with
some asperity—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not smoke, whatever they believe of German
women in England.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess, on receiving back her gift, was filled with
indignation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why cannot governesses smoke?” she asked. “If
I was a governess I should smoke to oblige.” And then,
in a fit of virtuous fury, she handed over the case to
Burbidge, with the lofty command of “Smoke at once.”
Later on, my little daughter told me, “I couldn’t help
it if <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> didn’t smoke.” And then added, “Anyway,
God knows I spent my money on her, and Burbidge
says that’s sure to count.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A soft sweet day. A gentle rain had fallen all through
the night, and the sense of spring was everywhere.
Soft mellow sunshine flooded into the house. How the
chestnut buds glistened in the sunlight, all damp, and
sticky, and a few even had begun to uncurl.</p>

<p class='c014'>The almonds were out in sheets of rosy pink blossom.
Bees were humming everywhere, and thrushes were
piping their jubilant strains on every gnarled apple tree.</p>

<p class='c014'>I asked at breakfast for my little maid, but I was
told that she was not yet down, and even our irreproachable
butler Fremantle seemed almost inclined to
laugh, if such a sedate and irreproachable person can
descend to such levity, as he told me that Miss Bess,
he feared, would be a little late that morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had, as it happened, many letters to answer, and so
forgot to trouble about Bess, for I had heard her chirp
like a bird between six and seven in the morning, and
therefore was not anxious. I remembered now that Bess
had been often up to tea at the Red House of late, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
that when Constance and she had met, they had
whispered much, and that Bess had often caught her
hand and held it tightly before parting, and then bubbled
over with happy laughter. Once, when I asked Bess
the cause of all this mystery, she replied, “Only white
secrets, mum,” and Constance had laughed too, and
repeated the child’s words, “Only white secrets.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Whilst I stuck down my letters, I recalled these
little half-forgotten episodes, when suddenly the door
was flung open with a bang, and Bess stood before me;
but not my every-day little Bess in short petticoats, and
white pinafore, and her locks hanging round her, with a
mane like a Church Stretton pony’s, but my little Bess
clothed in a fancy-ball costume, in that of a diminutive
jester of the fourteenth century, with cap and bells, in
little yellow and pink tights with satin embroidered vest,
and her luxuriant locks confined in a cap.</p>

<p class='c014'>She entered shaking her bells merrily, and as I
started up in surprise, she exclaimed, “Don’t say anything,
mamsie, please don’t. Wait till you have heard
my verse, or you will spoil everything. Constance has
learnt it me, and I have said it over and over again. You
see it is All Fools’ Day, and I must give you a surprise,
for Nana says, a surprise is next best to a birthday.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And then my little girl faced me, in the middle of
the old chamber, with the great stone altar as a background,
and piped aloud in her gay childish way. The
old rhyme somewhat altered—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When April her Folly’s throne exalts,</div>
      <div class='line'>While Dob calls Nell, and laughs because she halts,</div>
      <div class='line'>While Nell meets Tom, and says he too must play,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then laughs in turn, and laughing runs away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let us my muse thro’ Folly’s harvest range</div>
      <div class='line'>And glean some moral into Wisdom’s grange.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN APRIL FOOL</div>

<p class='c014'>It is an old rhyme, and I am told that Constance
had taught it to my little maid. I stood looking at my
dear little fool, all blushes and sweet smiles. “Constance,”
continued Bess, “was sure it would make you
laugh.” And then, after a pause, she added, “I have
not done yet. Listen; I know all the funny things,
pit-pat. Miss Weldon may not find me clever, but Constance
says I learnt at once what she taught me. You
see, mum, it is all fun, and fun with Constance is
better than boxes of sugar-plums;” and here my little
lass began to cut a hundred capers, to jingle her bells,
and to dance gaily, calling out, “There are heaps of
funny things to do. I must send Burbidge on a
sleeveless errand, tell Absalom to go for the map of the
Undiscovered Islands, and send Célestine for pigeons’
milk, and won’t she be cross! Crabs won’t be in it, no,
not if they were steeped in vinegar for a month, Nana
says.” And away danced my little lass into the brilliant
April sunshine.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='ce-caption'>THE CHAPEL HALL.</p>
<p class='le-caption'><i>Photo by Miss K. Wintour.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>I did not catch what she said to the old gardener
outside, but I heard a deep roar of laughter from
Burbidge, and a bass duet of guffaws, from Absalom and
Roderick; and a minute later Burbidge entered from the
garden and told me, his face beaming with honest
pleasure, that “Miss Bess was the gayest little Folly
that had ever come to Wenlock, and would surely make
folks laugh like an ecall come what might.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A few minutes later, and Bess flew off to her old
nurse and to Auguste, and both I heard, by their shrill
exclamations, affected to be overcome with laughter at
her approach. Inside and outside, on this first of April,
I heard sounds of merriment, as if a return to old customs
had come back, and as if loud and jocund mirth had not
died out of simple hearts. I thought of all the old games,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
plays, quips, and pranks, that the old walls of the Abbey
Farmery must have heard and seen in the Middle Ages,
for even the monks allowed times of folly and revelry,
at Yule-tide and Candlemas, I have read; and on the
first of April, All Fools’ Day, many must have been
the hearty laugh, and simple joke, that folks made and
passed on each other in Wenlock town, and all over
old England.</p>

<p class='c014'>I popped my letters into the box for post, and
stepped out, as my task for the day was accomplished.
The morning was enchantingly beautiful. “Old Adam”
glistened beneath the sundial like a wondrous jewel,
the eyes in his tail seemed of a hundred tints. He
appeared, as Buffon said, “to combine all that delights
the eye in the soft, and delicate tints of the finest
flowers, all that dazzles it in the sparkling lustre of
gems, and all that astonishes it, in the grand display of
the rainbow.” His tail appeared of a hundred tints,
and the red gold of the featherlets round the eyes
flashed as if illuminated by fire. His grey, subdued
wives, walked meekly beside him, and cast upon him
humble glances of admiration, while he strutted before
them with the pride of a Scotch piper, and expanded
his tail with a strange mechanical whirr, that recalled
the winding-up of some rich, elaborate, modern toy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Down by the Abbey pond I saw the two swans
swimming, but, every now and then, the male bird
seemed almost to leap out of the water in the delight
of spring, and beat the water with his great snowy
wings as he drove across the glass-like expanse at a
furious rate, making the little wavelets rise and fall
and dance, in a crystal shimmer over reeds and grass.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly a little moor-hen dipped and bobbed out of
the reeds. With an angry cry, one of the swans went
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
for her, and I thought, for a moment, the poor little
bird must have fallen a victim to his murderous beak;
but the little black bird, as Burbidge would have said,
“was nimble as ninepence,” and doubled, and dived,
before her enemy could reach her. It was very good to
be out. Life seemed enough. The island in the centre
of the Abbot’s pond had become a sheet of primroses,
and looked as if it had been sown with stars; and as I
stood in the garden, the scent of the crimson ribes
reached me. What a rich perfume it was! and what a
distance it carried. In the full sunshine it was almost
like incense, swung before the high altar of some old-world
cathedral. I wandered away into the red-walled
garden. How busy Burbidge was! The fir branches
and matting were to be taken down off the tea-roses,
and away from the beautiful purple and lavender
clematises, my autumn splendours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WINTER COVERINGS REMOVED</div>

<p class='c014'>Beautiful Mrs. George Jackman, that shone like a
great full moon in the dusk on clear summer nights,
was now to be allowed “to open out,” as gardeners say,
and the sun and soft winds were once more to play
with her tender leaves, and delicate tendrils.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the exquisite tea hybrid roses, such as Augustine
Guinoiseau la France, and that richest of all the noisettes,
William Allen Richardson, were to dispense with their
protecting fir branches. The time had come for them to
feel the joy of full sunlight again, and the tree peonies
were no longer to be enveloped in tawny fern branches,
or to lie smothered in litter.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I stood in the pathway, I heard Burbidge walking
up and down the paths, giving orders in the Shropshire
tongue that I love so well.</p>

<p class='c014'>A mantle of spring splendour had fallen upon all.
Lines of yellow crocuses shone like threads of gold.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
Crown Imperials were opening their rich brown, metallic-looking
blossoms. Pink and white daphne bushes perfumed
the air, and I noted that a host of hungry bees
were humming greedily round them. Chionodoxas of
all shades, were looking enchantingly fair. The blue
Sardensis was opening its petals, of the same wonderful
sapphire-blue shade as the Alpine gentian. Then in
blossom also I noted Chionodoxa Luciliæ, that had the
delicacy and daintiness of a piece of china, and lovely
Alleni, that recalled the beauty of a sunset sky when the
gold is dying, and when celestial amber is dissolving
and melting into exquisite tones of mauve and lavender.</p>

<p class='c014'>A little later, I found Burbidge hard at work pruning
my great bed of hybrid teas, and hybrid perpetual
roses, that I have planted with alternate rows of old Dutch
and Darwin tulips, with English and Spanish irises,
and with lines of grape and Botryoides hyacinths. “Us
must get a bit of the bush off,” said my old gardener,
as he plied his pruning scissors. I begged him, however,
not to cut my hybrid teas too hard, as now so
many gardeners are inclined to do, for roses in Shropshire,
it seemed to me, did not like too much of the
knife, or of the French drastic treatment. “Let it be
a rose <em>bush</em> in England,” I pleaded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Right you are, ma’am,” replied Burbidge, “for
there’s many as uses the knife as a child the whip.
Most of the roses here be on their own roots, and so,
healthy and abiding. Manetti stuff have blooms big as
saucers the first year, but go out the next year like
candles as the wind’s overmastered. They be like most
fandangles—no stay in them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VERMILLION ROSE</div>

<p class='c014'>So saying, my old friend plied his scissors vigorously,
and the click, click, resounded all through the garden.
Before I left the red-walled garden, I had a word with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
my old gardener about my hedge of Austrian briars.
What a wonderful single rose it is, and the variety is
very ancient. Parkinson mentions it in his “Theatre
of Plants,” and calls it “the vermilion rose of Austria.”
If we prune it this year, we shall get no flowers, I
lamented, and I am always very loth to let the pruning
shears work their will with my pet rose. Then I turned
to my moss roses: pink, white, purple, and the most
beautiful variety of all, the old crested. They were all
big bushes and must be kept in shape, but should not
be pruned in the ordinary sense.</p>

<p class='c014'>Besides these sorts already named, I grow in my
garden the beautiful roses of Japan—the purple and
white, and the semi-duplex kinds, all of which bear such
superb hips in the autumn. I told Burbidge that we must
net some of the bushes in autumn, and that I would try
later and get some German recipes for making them into
preserves. In Elizabethan days, I have read, “Cooks
and their ladies did know how to prepare from hips
many fine dishes for their tables.” Burbidge scoffed at
this notion. “Let the wild things be, marm,” he said
to me; and added, “I never heard of much that was
good wild, but nuts.” At this I laughed and replied,
“Wait and see—and taste.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge told me, that he proposed to carry out
the bees in their little wooden houses next week. “Come
next Thursday, bee operations should begin,” my old
friend assured me. Nine was the hour chosen, and, if
fine, “us will have the masks, so that come a breakage
the little brown folk can’t come to us—and the
vermin make sore flesh of us.” To-day, as I went into
the tool-house I heard the bees buzzing angrily, as if
they could not keep quiet for anger.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To-morrow,” Burbidge then informed me, he and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
the boys would paint all the “bees’ homes over,
save the lips, in different colours.” These must, in his
language, remain “simple;” but “come Thursday, us
will take off the zinc stopper on each, and then the little
brown uns can roam as they list.”</p>

<p class='c014'>All last winter, since November, the bees had lived
in the tool-house, and had been artificially fed for the last
fortnight, so that, to use my old friend’s words, “they be
fair nasty with temper, and buzzin’ like an organ on fire.”
And now nothing remained but for Auguste, as he always
did, to make them one last meal of burnt sugar, and
solemnly to “inviter ces messieurs à faire leur miel.”
Their appointed time of liberty was at hand, and in a
few days the little brown folk would fly into the sunshine
with pæans of joy.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went into the tool-house with Burbidge. Burbidge
is a man of order. Every night he makes “his
boys” hang up the tools, after cleaning them with care.
Those not in use shine brightly against the wall. Every
night they are rubbed clean with a rag steeped in oil.
Great strings of onions hung from the massive oak beams.
During bad days in winter, when the snow lay on the
ground, Burbidge and his men mended the fruit nets,
painted the water-cans a brilliant red, or green, made
wooden labels, and got ready, as they called it, “for the
comin’ of summer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There, along one side, were the beehives, some eight
in all—all to be painted in different colours. Burbidge
holds the view that no two should be painted the
same colour, so that each hive, as he calls it, “should
drop on their own colour sharp.” What truth there
may be in this idea I cannot say, but I was delighted
to oblige my old friend in this respect, for I, too, like
bright colours in a garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
Burbidge took out of an oak locker his colour board
for the year. “I know, marm, as yer be tasty with a
needle,” he said, “and I’ll leave it to you to say what
pleases you and the brown folk most.” I suggested
shades of blue, and told him of the Scotch belief that
bees of all colours love blue best. But Burbidge would
not admit this. “I never heard <em>that</em> in Shropshire,” he
said stoutly. “Don’t believe it, nor a letter of it. Orange
or purple, I believe, be every bit as good as blue.” Then
I asked Burbidge about the old Shropshire bees that
learned folks in bee-lore have told me were descended
from the old wild bees that the British had, and of which
there are still swarms in straw skeps in far-away farmhouses
nestling against the Clee. But about these wild
bees Burbidge knew nothing, but only felt certain that
anything “as be Shropshire born be bound to be
good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I chose the colours—red, flame, crimson,
salmon, mauve, pink, the delicate shade of the autumn
crocus, jonquil yellow, and one or two shades of blue—and
particularly the dear old-fashioned bleu de Marie
that one meets in an Italian sky, as beautiful in its way
as the breast of “old Adam” (the peacock) against a
yew hedge on a fine March morning in full sunlight.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a lovely spring morning on that Thursday, the
appointed day for the removal of the bees to summer
quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOONLIGHTERS AT WORK</div>

<p class='c014'>Bess and I had a cup of milk and a slice of bread
and butter, the best of all morning breakfasts, and ran
out to see the sport. Burbidge was there with his boys,
looking all of them like marauders, or moonlighters, for
their faces were clothed with masks and their hands
were covered with thick gloves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess grasped tight hold of my hand. “Mamsie,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
how wicked they look, as if they meant to kill some
one,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c014'>As to Mouse, she could not contain her displeasure.
She gave a series of low growls, and, for all she knew
them, did not like their coming too near us.</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge propped back the garden gate with a stout
staff. Then they carried the little wooden houses out.
What an angry sound of buzzing went on inside, as
the men bore them along. “Steady, steady!” cried
Burbidge, in a tone of command, “or the little brown
people will burst themselves with rage, and then, boys,
it will be run for it who can.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After this note of warning, “the two boys” advanced
very gently and placed the beehives in turn along the
side of a path under the shade of an apple grove, and
stood them facing south and east. “That be your
home,” said Burbidge, and then gravely proceeded to
whisper “a charm.” What that was I have never been
able to discover, for Burbidge declared it to be a secret
between him and the little brown ’uns, and if it was
known the good would go with “gossamer wings.”
There is something about spring and blossom, and sun,
and gentle rain, an old woman once told me, but the
exact words old Nelly Fetch wouldn’t tell me, and
declared, like Burbidge, “that charms and rhymes were
best kept between bees and bee-keepers, same as words
to the bees when death had visited a family.” It is
believed in Shropshire that bees are canny, touchy folk,
and that those who wish to keep them must be civil and
knowledgeable, and, “plaize ’em as little sweethearts,” as
an old cottager once said to me, “or the bees wud mak’
yer rue it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Whispering a death” is still a common custom.
I remember once asking a farmer’s wife, who used to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
noted for her bees, if she had any honey to sell, and
being gravely told that she was out of bees, for that
they had forgotten when the master died to whisper his
death to them, and in consequence the bees had taken
to the woods in displeasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PAINTS NEXT BEST TO WATER”</div>

<p class='c014'>Bess and I watched the proceedings, and when all
the hives were fixed in their places, we put on old aprons
and helped to daub on the paint. Burbidge had mixed
little cans of each colour, pink, yellow scarlet, and
flame, crimson, jonquil, and blue. Bess was delighted
with the little pots and the brushes. “Mamsie, I am
certain of one thing,” she said, “paints are next best to
water.” And in a few moments the little face, hands,
and pinafore, reflected all the colours of the rainbow.</p>

<p class='c014'>In ten minutes or so, we had given each hive one
coat of colour, and we never give more. Then we all
went and stood at the other end of the garden to see
the effect of our handiwork.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fine, very fine,” exclaimed Burbidge, admiringly.
“A horse in bells couldn’t look smarter.” And Bess added,
“Mamsie, it’s like a bunch of flowers, only there are no
leaves.” As we remained there, Auguste came on the
scene. He appeared with a pail of syrup to feed the bees,
for bees will always feed with avidity when put out first
into the air, however dainty or reluctant they have been
to eat when kept in confinement. A large bottle with a
broad opening, full of thick syrup, was filled, and fixed
upside down on the top of each hive. We heard behind
the perforated zinc a mighty din. “Messieurs les
abeilles crient pour leur dîner,” said Auguste.</p>

<p class='c014'>Overhead was the sunshine, and the bees scented
the breeze. Burbidge filled each bottle, and then replaced
the wooden lid of each hive. “Stand back,
marm!” he cried, “and you, too, Monsieur.” Then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
Burbidge called his “boys,” and they removed the little
pieces of zinc that had kept the bees so long prisoners.
Out they flew with exultant hums and buzzes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They wud have liked to cut their way through,”
cried Absalom, “but zinc, for all their cunning, be the
masters of they.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’ll be contented now,” laughed Burbidge.
“Sugar and sunshine, what more can a bee desire?”</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a great art in making bee syrup, like there
is in doing most country things. Syrup should be clear
and of the right thickness, and not too liquid; above
all, it should not be too thin, so as to pass too quickly
through the muslin, or, in Burbidge’s words, “it would
drown the bees like flies in a jar of cream.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After watching the bees come out and fly round in
exultant joy, Bess and I returned to the house, for, as
Bess said, the “bee play” was over for to-day. How
busy the little brown people will be gathering fresh
honey, flying amongst the arabis and searching for
celandines and primroses.</p>

<p class='c014'>We went in, and Bess ran up to her lessons. Alas!
study to my little maid is always a period of sadness.
“Real children never like lessons,” is my little girl’s
dictum. They don’t like useless things; and to Bess,
French, geography, history, and music are all useless
and worthless acquisitions. As I sat and embroidered
in the Chapel Hall, I was suddenly told that a boy outside
wished to speak to me. I left a carnation spray, a
copy of a design of one of Mary Queen of Scots’, and
looked up to welcome Thady Malone, a little Irish lad,
who, with his father and mother, had lately come into the
parish.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady is the terror of the locality, and the hero of
all the naughty-boy stories of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">“MORE DEVIL THAN BOY”</div>

<p class='c014'>According to my old gardener, who looks at him with
an evil eye, “Thady be more devil than boy.” Burbidge
declares that Thady is a plague, and a sore to the town,
and “wull be the death of some ’un, unless he kills
hisself first.” The fact is, Thady has done every naughty
thing conceivable. He has fired woods, put strings
across roads, I have been told, to try and trip up his
natural enemy, James Grogan, the reigning policeman,
and even put logs across the little local line, I have been
assured; but this he stoutly denies himself. He has
been thrashed by indignant farmers for running their
sheep, and yet, as Bess says, always turns up “naughty
and nice,” with the politest of manners, which he gets
from “auld Oireland,” and the sweetest and most innocent
of baby faces out of which natural wickedness ever
peeped.</p>

<p class='c014'>A minute later and Thady stood before me, bare-legged
and bonny, with an expectant smile in his eyes.
I opened the conversation by asking him from where
he came? “Right from Mrs. Harley.” And he added,
with a catch in his throat, “The poor lady is like to die
entirely, judging by what Mrs. Betty said, and so I have
come to you to see what your leddyship can do to stop
the disease.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady spoke in the most engaging brogue, and he
had the sunniest, pleasantest smile in the world. He
stood before me, with his little bare feet shyly touching
the fringe of the carpet.</p>

<p class='c014'>No other child in the old town goes barefoot. He is
known at Wenlock by the nickname of “Naughty Bare-legs,”
and has a shock of curly hair and dancing grey-blue
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll come at once,” I said. “But why, Thady,
have they sent you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
Thady scratched his head and looked puzzled, declared
he didn’t know, but protested there was nothing
he wouldn’t do to oblige Mrs. Harley, for all, he averred,
“she’s a hathan, and never says a prayer to the blessed
Virgin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It appeared that once some naughty boys at Homer
nearly succeeded in drowning Mrs. Harley’s tortoiseshell
kitten, but that Thady, hearing the poor little beast
mew, fearlessly came to its rescue, fought his way
through the thick of the band of miscreants, and told
them they were nothing but base robbers, that they
should be the death of something bigger; and before
they had recovered from their surprise, had dashed
through the ring, plunged out of the brook, and carried
off poor pussie victoriously. After this, Mrs. Harley
had always been a friend of his, filled his pockets with
damsons in autumn, and apples, and when the world
turned a cold shoulder on him, never failed to hold out
to him the hand of friendship.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For all I’m bad,” Thady would say, with a twinkle
in his eye, “Mrs. Harley never believes the worst of me,
and says (God bless her!) the day will come when the
country will be proud of me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no time to be lost, so I followed the little
bare-legged messenger out of the room, ran upstairs, put
on my hat and cape, and whistled my great dog to heel.
I said before starting, “Is there nothing I ought to take
to her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Whereupon Thady answered impetuously, with the
romance of his people, “There’s just nothing at all.
It’s just your face, my leddy, which the poor body wants
to get a sight of, considerin’ it’s never the shadow of the
blessed Virgin that she can bless her eyes with.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So without another word, Thady and I passed out of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
the Abbey, hurried across the emerald velvet of the
Cloister lawn, and let ourselves out by the little side
wicket, and so up the meadow past the station and away
to the top of the hill. “I cannot run any more,” at last
I cried to Thady, who had set the pace. “We must
walk. See, even Mouse is panting.” Thady stopped,
and then we settled down into a walk, and began after
a few minutes to chat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady looked at Mouse. “Proud I’d be, my leddy,”
he said, “if I owned such a dog. The constable, I’m
thinking, would look a small man beside me then.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this sally I had the ill-nature to suggest the
constable could shoot Mouse. Whereupon Thady, with
Hibernian readiness, replied, “Now I’m thinking the
dog would bite first.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“A KITTY WREN, BEGORRA!”</div>

<p class='c014'>A little later a bird flew across the path, upon which
Thady cried out, “A Kitty wren, begorra!” and before
I could stop him, had picked up a pebble to throw at a
little golden-crested wren that I saw running up a spray
of yew.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stop, stop,” I cried; “don’t throw it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why not?” said Thady. “There’s no law in England
or Oireland against killin’ a wren, beside”—and he what
the Shropshire folks call “rippled over” with laughter—“’twould
be a pretty shot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But I begged him to desist, and Thady, who is civility
itself, or, as he quaintly expresses it, “born dutiful
entirely to a leddy,” dropped his stone and we walked
on. After a few minutes’ conversation, I discovered that
Thady Malone was a naturalist of no mean repute, that
he could imitate the call and various notes of most of
the wild birds, and that he knew where to find their
nests. “And if it’s after such,” he added gallantly,
“that yer fancy takes yer, I’ll lead yer and show yer the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
rarest birds that fly. Only wait another fortnight,
pheasants, hawks, magpies, jays, blackcaps, blue-bonnets,
Nanny washtails, heather lenties, red-poles, cutty
wrens, corbie crows, Harry redcaps, and scores of
others.” Many of Thady’s names I did not know, but
Thady was graciously inclined, and assured me that he
would “learn my leddyship the true names.” “I don’t
call them after the books whatever,” he asserted, “but
same as the gipsy folks, and by the names known by the
people that lived in London, and elsewhere, before us
settled in Wenlock.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So it was agreed that Thady and I were to spend a
day in the woods.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let it be Saturday,” said Thady, authoritatively,
“for then there’s no school to plague the life out of a
fellow. I can climb and you can cap,” by which Thady
meant that I was to carry the eggs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thady,” I said, as we parted at Mrs. Harley’s
wicket, “you must come for me some Saturday. We
will go into the woods, and I will bring out luncheon,
and you shall climb the trees, whilst I and Bess will
search the ground; but we will take no nests, only look
at them and see the eggs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Leave the eggs, and what for will her leddyship do
that?” asked Thady, surprised. “That wud be like
catching a hare and not finding it in the pot the night
after.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” I remonstrated, “when you come with me,
you must play my game of bird-nesting. Anyway, I can
promise there will be nothing sick, or sorry, where we
have gone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady at this laughed a little contemptuously, and a
second later vanished behind a hedgerow, and I entered
Mrs. Harley’s cottage.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
It was a lovely morning, bright and joyous. The air
was full of spring odours, and in the song of the birds I
only heard the echo of universal joy. Yet I knew, the
moment I entered the cottage, that the hand of Death
was about to beckon my old friend away from the good
and useful life, that she had led so well and bravely, to
the other side of the bourn from which no man returns.</p>

<p class='c014'>Old Bessie met me. “Her’s goin’ fast,” she whispered,
and stood a moment in the sunlight, hot tears
almost blinding her poor old eyes. Then, as I hesitated,
she touched me gently on the arm and murmured,
“Come up, come up. Glad her’ll be to see you, for all
her’s done with Homer, and this world too.” So I
mounted the stairs and again found myself in Mrs.
Harley’s presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Outside beyond the Severn and the Wrekin, the sun
was shining gaily. Inside the little chamber, all was
spotlessly clean, I noted, as I entered the bed-chamber.
I saw the dying woman wanted something, from the way
in which her face moved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“A FAIR DAY TO GO HOME”</div>

<p class='c014'>“Light, light,” she murmured as I touched her
hand; and then, very low, “A fair day to go Home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her’s been talking of nothing but goin’ home,”
said Betsy, reverently; “and her’s goin’ sure, same as
gospel truth.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All’s at peace,” whispered my old friend, and took
a long, far look of the great hill of which all Shropshire
men are so proud. So, smiling tenderly and loving the
distant scene, her head sank back, and she seemed
gently to fall asleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How peaceful!” I said, awestruck.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Lord have a-called her, and her work be done,”
said Betty solemnly, a little later. “’Tis a good thing,”
she added, “to have done good work, and I think the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
Lord loved her for all she was lowly and never trod in
high places.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I left Betty, and the triumphant serene face, in
the little whitewashed chamber. As I departed, I was
conscious of having touched the fringe of a very holy
garment.</p>

<p class='c014'>I passed out. And as I met the gladness of the outside
world, I knew that some of my old friend’s radiance
was still lighting my path. After all, I know no better
or more blessed things than simple faith, and a noble
life, ended by His supreme grace.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mouse followed at my heels, dutifully walking close
behind me. It is curious, the way in which a dog that
is often our companion, reflects our mood. The great
hound knew that I was absorbed, and gave way to no
frolic, chased no rabbit, but kept near, watching me out
of her topaz eyes solemnly and with marked concern.</p>

<p class='c014'>A great stillness seemed to belong to the afternoon.
The sun was hidden beneath tender lavender clouds. I
crossed a stile and walked amongst the budding grass.
Suddenly out of a wood, for the first time in the year, I
heard the mystic voice of the cuckoo, calling, calling as
if out of a dream.</p>

<p class='c014'>What a delightful eërie sound it is! Not like a real
bird, but like some voice from another world, with its
strange power of reiteration, a voice which we cannot
do otherwise than listen to; for, as Sir Philip Sidney
said, “The cuckoo cometh to you with a tale to hold
children from their play, and old men from the chimney
corner.” From all time men have loved his cry. In
the “Exeter Book” occurs the passage—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sweet was the song of birds,</div>
      <div class='line'>The earth was covered with flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cuckoos announced the year.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CRY OF THE CUCKOO</div>

<p class='c014'>I did not see the bird, which lent enchantment to
his song. I listened, with budding daisies at my feet,
and over Wenlock spire a magic purple light. He
seemed to me no bird, but a spirit calling to the world
with a gladness that we cannot know. Death and winter
must come, but for all that, spring is here, he seemed
to say.</p>

<p class='c014'>Death had come near me, even touched me half an
hour ago, but for all the solemn sadness I felt a brief
time ago, the joy of life seized me afresh.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I wandered home across the peaceful fields, the
Cuckoo’s call seemed spoken and repeated from coppice
to hedgerow, and in every mossy dingle. The old
nursery rhyme I used to say in childhood came back
to me—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In April</div>
      <div class='line'>The Cuckoo shows his bill;</div>
      <div class='line'>In May</div>
      <div class='line'>He sings all day;</div>
      <div class='line'>In June</div>
      <div class='line'>He alters his tune;</div>
      <div class='line'>In July</div>
      <div class='line'>Away he’ll fly;</div>
      <div class='line'>Come August</div>
      <div class='line'>Fly he must.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Yes, I say, fly he must, with summer which is “the
sovereign joy of all things,” as Piers Ploughman wrote
long years ago, and then autumn, and the long chill
nights of winter.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is always a mystery about the cuckoo, as to
where he comes from, and where he goes. Far down in
the south of India, I have been told, is the only place
where the cuckoo is to be found summer and winter
alike, calling in the tropics his strange, mystic cry. Be
this as it may, he is never with us in Shropshire till the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
second week in April, and vanishes like a ghost early in
August.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some days later, and it was Palm Sunday, one of the
great festivals of old England during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is but little sign left now of the blessing of
the boughs, as the rite was performed in mediæval
times, save that nearly all the boys present had cut
sprigs of the wild willow and placed them in their
button-holes, and my little maid, by her old Nana’s
wish, had a spray pinned in also, amongst the ribbons of
her hat. What a lovely blossom it is, that of the wild
willow. How delicate the soft grey, and how lovely the
brilliant shades of gold. How wonderful is the mixture
of both colours, and how exquisitely gold and grey melt
into each other.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I sat in our pew on the northern side of the
church, I thought of the old Church Service that once
was held there. After the Mass, I have read, it was
usual that there should follow the hallowing of the
branches and flowers by the priest. I thought, as I sat
in church in Protestant England, of how the priest, up
to the first half of the sixteenth century, and for long
centuries before, stood forth in scarlet cope and blessed
the sweet branches and the first flowers of the year. I
liked to recall the old rite and custom of entreating the
Almighty to bless and sanctify “his creatures,” by
which was meant branch and blossom, which were laid
by lay brothers and novices at the foot of the altar, and
then it was nice to think how branch and blossom were
broken up and blest, and a spray given to all the devout
people assembled. It was a pretty and holy usage,
and I could not but feel regret, that so gracious a rite
was lost. It must have been a delightful service for
little children to witness, and a sweet memory for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
old who could remember the happy springs of years
gone by.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we came out of church, I told Bess about the old
custom. And Bess said dryly, “Now we have to bless
our palm branches ourselves;” and added with the
strange intuition of a child, “I think it was better when
God did part of it, don’t you, mamsie?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A STROLL IN THE CHURCHYARD</div>

<p class='c014'>After the service, we took a stroll into the picturesque
old churchyard, surrounded by old black and white timber,
and Georgian houses of glowing red brick. There was
standing by the door by which we entered the church, the
remains of an old stone cross and several tombs, which,
I have been told, were brought from the ruined Abbey
Church. The grass was full of glittering daffodils, which
shone like stars, and the scent from the ribes and
Daphne bushes filled God’s acre with sweetness. Bess
and I walked round the churchyard.</p>

<p class='c014'>I told her of the little room over the church-porch
with its little narrow window. Such a holy little room,
I said. In such a room, I think, holy Master George
Herbert must have written; and from that I went on to
tell my little girl about Sir Thomas Botelar, the first
priest who lived at Much Wenlock after the expulsion
of the monks.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='le-caption'><i>Photo by Mr. W. Golling.</i></p>
<p class='ce-caption'>SIR THOMAS BOTELAR’S HOUSE.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='c014'>“Tell me about him,” said Bess, eagerly. “I like
to hear about good monks and priests from you, although
Nana says they were all wicked, and walled up poor girls.
But perhaps,” added Bess, thoughtfully, “they were not
all as wicked as she thinks; leastways, there may have
been a few good ones just sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After luncheon I took down the printed sheets in
which are preserved Sir Thomas Botelar’s entries, for,
alas! his original manuscript perished in the great fire
at Wynnstay in 1859. And I read aloud such passages
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
as I thought my little girl would follow, at least in
places.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I read aloud, Constance was ushered in. She did
not know Sir Thomas’s register and begged me to go on
reading, so I continued to read. The old papers, I told
her in a pause, embraced eight years of Henry VIII.’s
reign, went through that of Edward VI.’s, took in the
whole of Queen Mary’s, and gave the four opening years
of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. All Sir Thomas’s sympathies
were with the old order of things, I begged her to
remember, and then I went on reading.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘In February, 1546, on the 5th day of the month,
word and knowledge came to the borough of Much
Wenlock that our Sovereign Lord King Henry VIII.
was departed out of this transitory life, whose soul,’” Sir
Thomas added, “‘God Almighty pardon.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sir Thomas Botelar,” I told Constance, “was the last
Abbot of St. Peter and St. Paul’s Monastery at Shrewsbury.
After the Dissolution, the King turned away all
the monks, and Sir Thomas became, after a short time,
Vicar of Much Wenlock, but his heart remained in the
cloisters of his former abbey.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I turned to a notice a little further down the
page—</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘On the 13th April of the same year three convicts
were buried, and one was a child of eleven.’ Poor little
girl,” I said, “what a terrible bald statement of misery!
What could so young a child have done to merit
death?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot think,” exclaimed Bess. “Perhaps cursed
and swore and scratched; but, even then, had she no
father or mother to forgive her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Only God,” said Constance, softly.</p>

<p class='c014'>And then I begged them to listen to an account of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
funeral of an excellent priest, and obviously a very learned
man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OLD CHURCH REGISTERS</div>

<p class='c014'>“‘Sir William Corvehill, priest,’” I read, “‘was laid
in a tomb of lime and stone, which he had caused to be
made for himself. Sir W. Corvehill was excellently and
singularly expert in divers of the VIJ liberal sciences,
especially in geometry. He was also skilled in the
making of organs and in the carving of masonry, in the
weaving of silk, and in printing. Besides he was,’” adds
Sir Thomas, “‘a very patient man and full honest in his
conversation and living.’” Then, after commending his
soul to the care of God, Sir Thomas wound up quaintly
by declaring that, “‘All this country hath a great loss
from the death of Sir William Corvehill, for he was a
good bell-founder and a maker and framer of bells.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I found a notice of a marriage. “‘Here was
married,’” ran the old register, “‘Thomas Munslow
Smith and Alice Nycols;’” and added, “‘The bride was
wedded in her smock, and barehead.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“When I’m married,” said Bess, loftily, “I’ll have
a veil and some flowers. Nana says it isn’t proper to
be married without a veil. ’Twould be as silly as papa
ploughing, or you, mama, plucking fowls.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I didn’t enter into the question of parental ridicule,
but I looked down the vicar’s entries and read, “‘Poor
Sir John Baily Clerke, otherwise called John Cressage,
died. It was about 9 of the clock,’” wrote Sir Thomas,
“‘and at the manor place of Madeley.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess had often heard the story from me of the poor
old man who, after surrendering his monastery, retired
broken-hearted to die at Madeley. When I came to this
part of the register, she broke out indignantly with—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why couldn’t they leave <em>our</em> abbot alone? I can’t
abear that old Henry VIII. He did nothing but wicked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
things: cut off his wives’ heads and pulled down churches
and nice buildings. Yet Nan and Burbidge call him a
good man. I think people ought to be good in a different
way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess was quite excited, and Constance had to take
her on her knee to soothe her, and thus she sat on
listening, with a scarlet face.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I read how, after the death of King Edward,
Sir Thomas and all the people made great joy over the
proclaiming of the Lady Mary Queen of England. I
read also how the people of Bridgnorth “fair cast up
their caps and hats, lauding, thanking, and praising
God Almighty, with ringing of bells and making of
bonfires in the streets,” and how the same joy was
evinced at Shrewsbury, and at Much Wenlock.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the first year of Mary’s reign on June 16th, I
read that the altar of our blessed Lady within this
church (of the Holy Trinity) was again built up and
consecrated afresh, and evidently Sir Thomas rejoiced.</p>

<p class='c014'>A month later, the Bishop of Worcester, the Lord
President of the Marches, coming with Justice Townesynde,
stopped on their road to Bridgnorth at Much Wenlock,
and were entertained by Richard Lawley at the
Ash, the fine old timber house in Spital Street, where,
at a later date, Charles I. and Prince Rupert both slept
on different occasions.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then followed a description of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> held in their
honour. We learnt how the house was gaily decked
with cloths of Arras, with the covering of beds, bancards,
carpets and cushions, and how the table was laden with
pears and dishes of apples of the previous year. We
wondered how they could have been kept. Also with
cakes, fine wafers, claret, sack and white wine, and after
much pleasant feasting and pleasant intercourse, how
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
“Mr. Justice rose and gave the Burgesses great and
gentle thanks for their cost and cheer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish that I, too, mamsie, had been there, for I,
too, would like to have eaten pears in summer, and have
seen all their gay carpets,” exclaimed Bess.</p>

<p class='c014'>A little later on in the pamphlet I found the announcement
of Queen Elizabeth’s being proclaimed Queen after
the death of her sister. Sir Thomas made this entry
evidently with rather a heavy heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I closed the little book, Constance took it in her
hand and looked over the pages.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How many were hanged in those days!” she said
sadly. “There are mentions of executions for sheep
stealing, for murder, for robbery; and what a number
of convicts, even children of quite tender years.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she alluded to the immense age of many of the
parishioners named. Agnes Pyner was said to be seven
score years when she received the blessed sacrament just
before death. John Trussingham declared that he was
seven score years, and that at the age of four-score years
he had witnessed the battle of Blore Heath; whilst John
Francis, chief farmer at Callaughton, Sir Thomas
declared, was aged 107 years when he was buried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOAN OF POSENHALL</div>

<p class='c014'>Then Constance’s fingers flitted back to a past page,
and she read aloud a touching little entry about Joan
of Posenhall, a fair maiden of twenty-two years, who, it
was believed, “died of a canker in the mouth, which
disease her father ascribed to the smelling of rose
flowers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Could it have been a poisoned rose?” I asked, for
in those days many and subtle were the poisons used to
get rid of a fair rival.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Bess could not understand how a rose by its
scent could injure any one. “In my true fairy-stories,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
she said, “roses can only do good. They are only good
fairies’ gifts, and I know they can only come out of the
mouths of good girls—real good girls,” Bess repeated,
“so I don’t see how a rose could have hurt poor Joan.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Whereupon I explained matters to my little maid.
After a pause Bess exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I think ’tis best to live now, for anyhow
we’ve only doctors to kill us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To save us,” laughed Constance.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Bess would not allow this. “To kill us is what
Mrs. Burbidge says; and Nana says she won’t have a
doctor in at no price for herself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Bess jumped up from her chair, and declared
inconsequently that it was time to feed her puppy, and
darted out of the room, and Constance and I were left
alone. Upon which we fell to chatting about the great
quilt. “I have chosen the flowers, as you know,” she
said. And she enumerated one after another their
old-world musical names. “And now I want charming
words about sleep,” she added.</p>

<p class='c014'>I suggested from Sir Thomas Browne’s “Religio
Medici”: “Make my sleep a holy trance,” or “On my
temples sentry keep,” again from the same author
“Come as thou wilt, or what thou wilt bequeath,” from
Drummond of Hawthornden, or again, “Men like
visions are, Time all doth claim,” or “He lives who
dies to win a lasting fame.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must not also,” I said, “forget a beautiful
line from Mrs. Barrett Browning: ‘He giveth His
beloved sleep.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before leaving me, Constance told me that she and
Bess had a little game in hand—a real May frolic—“but
you must not know yet, it must be a surprise.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEEN OF THE MAY</div>

<p class='c014'>To this I at once gave my maternal sanction, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
then the nature of the “secret” was revealed to me.
Constance told me that she proposed to have a little
May dance for some eight of the little school maidens,
and that she would like Bess to take a part in the
festivities. Eight little maidens are to dance round the
maypole, which is to be decked with ribbons and many
flowers, and are to sing some old songs; and she added,
“If you have no objection, Bess is to say us a verse or
two from some old poets in honour of May morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I fell in readily with Constance’s little plans for a
village <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i>, and offered the old bowling green as a site
for it to take place. “The bowling green,” I said, “is
very sheltered; it is surrounded on three sides with yew
hedges, and I am delighted at the idea of Bess appearing
as the queen of the revels.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess is to be attired all in white with a crown of
flaming marsh marigolds on her head, and to bear in
her hand a staff decorated with primroses, cowslips, and
sprays of beech and willow.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just as Constance was leaving, Bess rushed in and
seized my friend’s hand, and called out impetuously,
“Have you told mamsie? May I? May I?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I nodded “yes,” and told my little maid that she
was to have a white muslin, a white wand of office,
posies of primroses and shining shoe buckles. Bess
was delighted, she hugged me and Constance rapturously
in turns, and said “it will be the best day of my life.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All we must hope will be a success,” laughed
Constance, as she departed up the pathway to the
old gate-house; “and we must pray for sunshine for
the sake of the little expectant maidens and anxious
mothers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Next morning I confided to Burbidge the plan of our
proposed revels, and informed him that I should like to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
ask in the villagers. Burbidge remarked in a lofty way
that he had no objection—a Yorkshire expression which
he acquired when a lad from a Yorkshire gardener; but
added severely, that they that come must keep to the
paths, not spoil <em>his</em> lawns, and scatter no lollipop papers,
or such-like dirt.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Burbidge’s old wife, Hester, showed a less conciliatory
spirit. In a foolish moment, as I happened to
meet her carrying Burbidge’s dinner to the tool-house,
I confided our secret. Upon which she told me sourly
that she was sorry to think “as there is to be play-acting,
and even dancing on the property—the monks,” she
declared, “were bad enough, but this would beat all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hester is descended from old Puritan stock, and
disapproves of all laughter and merriment. Burbidge,
who overheard her last words of censure, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tut, tut, my dear, you was young once. I can mind
thee fine as a horse in bells, for all thee’s old now and
that the rheumatics lay hold on thee, sharp as scissor
points. But the young uns they want their games and
their plays, for all as us is getting miller’s bags on our
pates.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Speak for yourself,” replied Hester, with acidity,
puckering up her withered visage. And then she
added with severity, “I never knew yet any good come
out, or wisdom, of play-acting. They be devil’s works,
and take my word for it,” and there she held up a
bony emphatic finger, “that the devil will claim toll,
for all as they seem mild and innocent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With which ominous remark Hester made over to
Burbidge his dinner, and hobbled up the back drive
homeward.</p>

<p class='c014'>“’Tis a pity,” said Burbidge, looking after his old
wife, “as good wine can turn to vinegay like that. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
Lord made her, but the old ’un” (the devil) “guides her
eyesight sure enough, and most times directs her tongue.
The fact is,” and the old man drew himself up straight,
“when yer think too much about hell, yer can never see
heaven. My mother used to say that, and for all she
was a Methody body, it be gospel truth.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EASTER SUNDAY</div>

<p class='c014'>A few days later it was Easter Sunday. The bells
rang merrily, but we hurried off to church almost late;
for, according to Shropshire fashion, Bess had got a
new frock on for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c014'>It consisted of a pale mauve serge of the colour of
the autumn crocus blossoms which flower in the aftermath
in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the last fortnight dear old Nanny had been too
busy “to draw a breath,” to use her favourite expression,
and had sewn morning, afternoon, and evening, to get
my little maid’s frock completed by Easter Sunday.
For it is held in Shropshire to be most unlucky not to
be clad in fresh attire on that feast day of the Church.
Wherefore, whatever else was left undone, Bess’s frock
had to be finished for the festival.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The rooks,” murmured Bess, as we entered the
churchyard, “cannot say nothing, for all I have is
new—shoes, stockings, drawers, chemise, and frock.
And them,” alluding to the rooks, “them only spoils
old things, does them, mamsie?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you’re safe,” I laughed, and we passed up the
aisle.</p>

<p class='c014'>A peal of bells was ringing gaily. “How gay and
good it sounds,” whispered Bess, dreamily, “as if all
the world was good and playing.” Then we walked up
to our pew, and the mild delicate scent of primroses
greeted us everywhere. “I wish we had flowers every
Sunday,” said Bess, as she flumped down in her seat.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
“It seems to make God’s house like a posy. I think
it must be nicer for Him so.” The old columns were
festooned with garlands of flowers, and round the ancient
font were placed bunches of flashing marsh marigolds
and great branches of tender half-uncurled beech leaves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess looked round her, and said gravely in an undertone,
“I think the blessing will come this Sunday, for
I feel sure that God cannot see so many flowers about
without being pleased.” Then I said, “Hush!” for I
feared my little maid was talking over-much.</p>

<p class='c014'>Immediately after, the morning service began. At
the close, as the last hymn died away, Nana took my
little maiden off, whilst I remained on for the most
beautiful, and the most solemn, of all our Church
services.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sound of retreating footsteps was at last hushed.
The children had all left, and many of the people.
Then there was a pause, and then the opening prayers,
and I saw, in the dim light of the chancel window, the
vicar breaking the bread and preparing the wine, and
we were invited to the Lord’s Table.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was
shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting
life.” I seemed to hear the solemn words as in a trance.
Outside, through the old perpendicular window, the sun
was shining faintly, and from the glad world without
I heard the birds singing in a joyous chorus. Inside,
the great and solemn rite of Christianity was being
administered, and faith and love of Him who died for
the sins of men was visiting each faithful heart in a
rapture of holy delight. A few minutes afterwards and
I regained my seat. The spirit of the old world was
with me. How many pious hearts have offered up
prayer and thanksgiving before those altar rails! How
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
often has the blessed Sacrament come to faithful hearts,
as an elixir of the soul!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOLY SACRAMENT</div>

<p class='c014'>Owing, perhaps, to the joy of the world outside,
there was a great sense of triumph in such an Easter
Sunday. “Christ is risen!” seemed to be shouted
everywhere; His body had suffered pain and death,
but now the heavens were opening for the glory in
which death and pain could have no place. The glory
of His life was everywhere. For “with angels, and
archangels, and with all the company of heaven,” could
“we laud and magnify our Lord and praise the Most
High.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I came out of the church, and some of its mystic
radiance seems to cling like a cloud of splendour around
me. As I walked along, I thought of the founder of
the town church, Roger de Montgomery, the great Earl
of Shrewsbury, who founded also that of the Abbey close
by. The former, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, still
has its roof, and pious services are still performed
there every Sunday; whereas the Abbey church of the
Clugniac monks is deserted alike by prior and pilgrim.
Alone, my pigeons and the jackdaws fly amidst its aisles,
and only across grass and thyme can the outlines of the
high altar be discerned.</p>

<p class='c014'>I lingered at the church wicket. A soft shower had
just fallen, and dew-drops glistened on the grass like
pearls. A great white cross shone in splendour, still
wet, but of dazzling whiteness, almost like a pillar of
light in the morning sunshine. The birds on every bush
and wall were chanting anthems of delight.</p>

<p class='c014'>A minute later I passed out of God’s acre, and Bess
met me in the avenue. My little maid rushed up with
a bound of excitement.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thady is ill, mum,” she cried. “I heard Burbidge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
tell Nana so. He said ‘The little varmint be down
with a bad leg, and he hoped that would settle him for
a bit.’ And Nana said ‘she hoped it would, too, for
when boys were wicked they was best in bed.’ But I’m
sorry, sorry, for all Thady’s naughty, he’s never nasty.”
I sympathized with Bess, and promised that we would
visit Thady during the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c014'>After luncheon, we cut Thady a slice of plum-pudding,
and Bess put aside for him an Easter-egg.
“I had three,” she said, “and this one is sky blue,
and Auguste says that is the best colour of all and
sure to bring good luck. So you’ll see, mum,” she
added, “Thady will be right again and able to climb
the trees in no time after he has eaten my egg.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We prepared to start out, and took Thady the gifts
contained in the basket; but Bess declared that first
we must go into the ruins and pick her little friend a
bunch of daffydowndillies.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘A bunch of daffs on Easter Day</div>
      <div class='line'>Brings luck to the house, and peace in May.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Nan says so, and I believe it,” cried Bess. “Anyway,
Thady will like to look at ’em while he eats my
egg.” So we wandered into the rough grass inside the
ruined church to pluck a handful.</p>

<p class='c014'>How beautiful are spring flowers. All round it was
a blaze of brilliant blossoms. There were early Van
Thol tulips, like flames of fire, large rings of golden
daffodils, some of them with almost orange faces moving
in the soft winds, and then there were patches of
beautiful blue scilla sibirica, and in the distance the
star-like forms of the narcissi Stella, and Cynosure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MEAD OF BLOSSOMS</div>

<p class='c014'>For several autumns Burbidge and “his boys”
had planted for me great numbers of bulbs, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
result was, as Burbidge said, better “than a carpet of
delight.” These bulbs are now grown largely in
Lincolnshire, and in parts of Ireland. When they
arrived they looked small and meagre. They were not
at all the splendid, sleek, fat bulbs, that come from
Holland; but, to quote Burbidge, looked “poor little
shy customers;” but they were glad enough to find a
home in the Abbey turf. Before putting them in, we
skinned back the grass, dug up the soil to about six
inches, added a little leaf mould, took out any stones,
and popped in tulips, daffodils, snowdrops, crocuses,
and, for a later radiance when the hawthorn would be
out in snow, the rich double white narcissus, that
gardeners call, on account of its perfume and appearance,
the gardenia narcissus.</p>

<p class='c014'>We put in three to five bulbs in each little space.
After which we carefully replaced the grass, and beat
it well down, so that, after the first shower, no one could
have known that we had even moved the turf. Just
then much of the grass of the ruins was a sheet of
glory, reminding me in its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterre</span></i>-like beauty of the
foreground of some early Italian painter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every autumn Burbidge and his workers bring wheelbarrow
loads of leaf mould and decayed lawn grass,
and spread them over my “bulb forest;” and the result
is that every year the flower roots strengthen, and the
blossoms multiply.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess ran from group to group, until her hands were
full of different daffodils. “There’s luck here,” she
cried, “and see, they glitter like gold money, mamsie—that
must mean something good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We walked, laden with our gifts, till we reached
the Bull Ring. We paused at the door of an old
black and white house, with a broad pebble causeway
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
before it. On entering the cottage we found Thady
in bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, Thady, how did it happen?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was after a rook’s nest,” replied Thady, “and
the twig gave way entirely, and so I came down dang-swang,
as the folks say here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indade,” said his mother, Mrs. Malone, “it’s
afflicted I am in Thady. When he’s good he’s ill,
and when he’s well he keeps company entirely with the
Devil.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never fear, mother, whativer. ’Tis a bad boy as
can’t get good some day,” and Thady, for all his face
looked white and worn from pain, he burst into an irresistible
fit of laughter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon this Bess showered upon him yellow daffodils,
and I opened my basket containing the plum-pudding,
and Bess’s sky-blue egg, and an orange or two.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sure and God bless you,” said the good dame, his
mother, with enthusiasm. “They will please him finely,
for Wenlock is as dull as ditch water, for all they boast
that in days gone by once there was gay goings on here.
Bull and dog baitings, according to our old neighbour
Timothy Theobalds’ tales, and behind the Vicarage, cock
matches fit for a king, and pretty fights between the
young men behind the church. But, whatever there
was then, ’tis still now, and sleepy as Time.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MASTER THEOBALDS ON POLITICS</div>

<p class='c014'>As we left the cottage I met the neighbour of the
Malones, old Timothy Theobalds. He was a shrivelled
little old man, had been ount, or mole-catcher, for many
years, had driven cattle to market, and I have also
heard, was once earth-stopper to the Hunt. If what
his neighbours say is true, old Timothy is not now far off
a hundred. He receives annually a small pension collected
from three county families, has, I am told, cakes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
and beer at Yule-tide from his neighbours, and in his
own words, “a snap of somethin’ tasty, when he has a
mind, wherever he goes.” The old man is excellent company
for all his years, and has many a good story to
tell, of folks long since dead, and of the wild ways
and curious customs of old Shropshire, before the
days of railroads, when folks still believed in witches,
and in the power of divining rods, and danced, and
made merry at wakes and fairs. Like many other old
men, “Daddy” Theobalds is not exempt from grumbling,
and can use language, I fear, “fit to blow your
head off” if provoked. According to him, “Life’s a
poor thing now. No fun nor luck left. Yer mayn’t even
get a shillin’ nowadays for a vote if so be as yer has
one; though what good a vote can do a poor man if he
can’t sell it, I don’t know. They Radicals,” he told me
once, “were grand at givin’; but their gifts were
nought but mugs wi’out beer, or dishes wi’out beef;
they brought nought when yer speered in, but fandangles,
flummery and folly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Old Timothy I met leaning on his stick before his
door, clad in a long embroidered smock. He pushed
open the door. “Come in, marm,” he says, “and sit
yer down before the fire.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I entered his house whilst Bess dashed off to fetch
the pug-pup, exclaiming, “We must remember it is his
Easter Sunday,” and I and old Timothy were left alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>I made a remark upon the fine day, and told old
Timothy about the morning service and the lovely
flowers. Old Timothy did not respond. He holds to
church on Sunday, but rather as a preparation to a
Sunday dinner, than anything else, I fear; but as to
flowers, he “doesn’t think much of they, leastways not
in churches.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
“When I war a lad,” he said, “folks kept they for
May Day, and the lads and lasses then went out and
pulled blossoms and danced, for the fun of the land
wasn’t all dead then, as it is now. That be the proper
use of blows.” Then, after a pause, in a weary voice
old Timothy went on to say, “’Tis a deal decenter
now, no doubt, more paint about and print readen’, but
the fun and jollity be clean dead. When I war young,
folks often had a tidy bit saved, and when they had ‘a
do’ they spent it at home. The missus would bake
Yule-tide cakes or all souls, or snap-jacks, accordin’ to
the season, and the maister brewed a barrel of ale, and
then the couple wud call in the neighbours. Now ’tis
hoard up, and go away, as if yer could only laugh in
London or Birmingham, and never a cake or a sup for
friends or neighbours.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Folks could play well enough when I war a boy,”
and then old Timothy began to tell me of the old
“plays” as he called them. “This place, ‘Old Wenlock,’
as us used to call it, war cheery, and jolly, in
grandam’s days,” he told me. “Every spring there wud
come a man with a bull. Many is the one, I have heard
her say, was baited in this spot, just outside the doors.
The farmers and colliers from Ironbridge would bring
their dogs, and have three days’ drinking and amusement.
And,” continued old Timothy, “he war a mighty
fine man as cud count as his the best bull dog about.
Now folks be proud of their cricket, and of their football
matches, but the games can’t touch the old sports.”
Then after a pause, old Timothy said solemnly, “It
war a terrible undoing of England puttin’ down the old
plays. I mind,” the old man added, “how mad dad
war when they put down the bull-baiting at Ellesmere.
There used, in the old times, to be grand goings on there.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
Well, one Wake Monday, Mr. Clarke, ‘the captain’ as
they called him, put that down. Tom Byollin, I’ve
heard dad say, war leaden’ the bull round pretty nigh
smothered in ribbons, as war the good old custom, when
the captain ’e comes up and ’e said, ‘What be goin’ to
do with that there bull?’ ‘Bait ’im,’ said Tom, ‘we
allus bait a bull at Wake’s. ’Tis our Christian custom.’
But the captain he wudn’t have it. He war allus a
meally souled ’un, ’cording to dad, and one that left
a good custom, to take up with a new one, and so he
offered five pounds to Tom, and got round him by
biddin’ too a new pair of breeks—and so there war no
bull-baiten. Tom was mortal hard up, I’ve heard, but
to his dyin’ day he regretted the job, and used to cry
over his cups, because he had helped to ruin the land
by doin’ away with a good old practice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you ever see a bull baited?” I asked old
Timothy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“A ROYAL DO”</div>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, mam,” answered my old friend with pride,
“when I war at Loppington, I have myself seen the
sport, as quite a lad,” and as he spoke old Timothy’s
eyes lighted up with excitement. “It war a royal do.
For they had not only bulls, but bears. I mind me,”
he continued after a minute’s hesitation, “as it war
in 1825. There war great rejoicin’s. Folks druv and
came in from all parts, and it war a grand celebration,
and all given because the parson’s daughter war
marryin’ a squire. They said as the parson paid the
costs hisself bang off, he was that pleased at his daughter’s
grand marriage. But then parsons <em>were</em> parsons
in those days. They rode, shot, and wrestled, besides
preachin’. ’Tis true as there war a few what objected.
Now at Madeley Wakes they had grand games on too.
All the colliers, I’ve heard grandam say, used to come
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
down and bet free and easy, like gentlemen born. Many
was the time, I’ve heard ’em say, folks used to see the
collier folks ranged down to make a lane like for the
bull or bear to pass along. My word! as old Matt Dykes
used to say. It war a mighty question which looked
best, beast or dog, for when ’twas a bull, they only slipt
one to a time. ‘One dog one bull,’ that war what they
used to say to Madeley.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oaken-Gates, I’ve heard say, war the last place
where they baited the bull in Shropshire. And I allus
say,” said old Timothy, with a spark of enthusiasm,
“that ’tis a mighty fine feather in the cap of that
place, as it war the last as kept up the good old English
sport.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then old Timothy went on to tell me “how the bull
in 1833 at Madeley war a mighty game ’un, and tugged
that ferocious at the stake, that he broke abroad stake
and all, and with the chain charged down madly, and
hurted several what war standing by.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After a pause, old Timothy went on to tell me, “how
for all the Vicar of Loppington war reasonable and right
minded about the old sports, there war some even then,
as had ‘cakey’ and queasy stomachs about such enjoyments.”
And he went on to say how Mr. Anstice of
Madeley, and one Mortimer, as was vicar then, spoilt, in
his own language, sport cruel. “It war in this way,”
continued the old man, “the bull, a proper beast, war
baited three times; first, at the Horse Inn, then at
Lincoln Hill, and lastly, on Madeley Wood Green. At
the last bout, Squire Anstice and Parson Mortimer they
comed up with a handful of constables, but there war
hundreds of colliers and decent folks looking on, and
I war told that they could have chawed up constables,
squire, and vicar, if they had a mind.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
“And what saved ’em?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” answered Maister Theobalds, “for all the
vicar war a little ’un deformed, and some called him as
dry as a chip, he had a mighty fine tongue, and though
he’d hadn’t grit enough to thresh a hen, he’d hadn’t
no mortal fear, and he stood up and pleaded and spoke
same as if the bull had been his brother. And the bull
war sent away.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“LAMB-LIKE TO PUPS”</div>

<p class='c014'>Then after a little while Timothy added reflectively,
“There be mountains in a tongue. Grandam used to
say as Parson Mortimer seemed to hold God Almighty
inside him when he war angry, so terrible war he, not
that he ever war angry unless he waxed white hot about
sin, or cruelty, as he called it. He war a little ’un to
look at, but he had a mighty spirit, though lamb-like
to pups, childers, and wild wounded things. The biggest
fellows quailed before him when he took on in a
rampage, and none of them dared sin when he war by.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At that moment I heard my Bess tapping at the
door. “Lor, bless her,” said Timothy, “’tis the little
’un; how them does grow, the childers,” and he got up
and hobbled to the door. Then Bess ran in and bubbled
over with excitement about her May <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i>, for she had
met Constance on the road. She told old Master Theobalds
that he must come down and see her May dance.
“Sure I will, my pretty,” he said; “I’d like to see a
May-stang again, and a mass of lads and lasses dancing
round, as I have heard grandam talk about when she
war a likely wench.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the old man began to tell us of the old May
Days, and of the long-handed-down traditions of the
Shropshire May festival.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It war the fashion,” he said, “in the old time for
all the lads and lasses to wend their way to the Stanhill
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
Coppice or down to the great Edge Wood, and a merry
time they had. Old Gregson Child as war shepherd
to Farmer Dawson, that lived once at the Marsh Farm,
used to go with the lads, and they used to blow horns,
and one or two, if they had a mind, would tootle on the
flute, and others scrape on fiddles, till wood and field
fair swarmed with music, and so, they say, they got
them to the woods an hour or so after dawn. And
after a while, the lads and lasses would twine garlands,
and the lads would buss the lasses. And the lasses
would cry out, but let ’em do it again, and when they
had romped and sang, the boys and maids, fair smothered
in May branches, mead marigolds, posies of
primroses, and laxter shoots of beech and hazel, would
get them to their homes and hang up garlands and
posies to their lintels over their dad’s door, and take
to laughter and bussing again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ay, grandam used to talk of those times—merry
times for all they hung for sheep stealing, sure enough,
but the lads laughed ’twixt times gay as ecalls,” and
the old man bent before the dying fire, and seemed in
thought to plunge back to the days of the past, which
even he could hardly have seen.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Bess and I got up, and Mouse gave a deep
bark, and as I said good-bye, I repeated my invitation
for the First of May.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lor’, mam,” replied old Timothy, sadly, as he
opened the door, “it isn’t likely as I shall forget it,
for a piece of jollity don’t often come my way. ’Tis
dull and parson-like as they’ve made the world now.
Well, it is for the young ’uns to call for the tune
now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We passed into the sunlight, and saw the lads and
lasses hastening to school, and away up the streets I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
saw older lads and lasses in Sunday trim, dressed for
courting, and the Sunday walk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD MAY DAYS</div>

<p class='c014'>Is the world less merry, I asked myself, since old
Timothy’s grandam danced beneath the May-pole?
Have we forgotten how to laugh and sing in village and
hamlet, and is merry England steeped in grey mists?
I thought of what I had heard, as I walked along, and
tried to picture to myself that merry England of whom
a stranger wrote, “A merrier, gayer people breathe not
on God’s earth.” I thought of the time when the May
Festival was observed by nobles, and even by kings and
queens. I remembered how Chaucer, in his “Court of
Love,” tells us that early on May Day “went forth all
the Court, both most and least, to fetch fresh flowers,
and so bring back branch and bloom.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O Maye with all thy flowers, and thy green,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bright welcome, be thou faire, freshe May,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>exclaims the courtly knight Arcite. I recalled a passage
in Malory where the great prose poet makes
beautiful Queen Guinevere go a-maying with her lords
and ladies. In Henry VIII.’s reign the Court still went
a-maying, for Hall tells us how Henry, in his youth,
accompanied by his stately Spanish queen, “rose up
early with all their courtiers” to enjoy the old English
custom, and of how the Court went forth with bows
and arrows, shooting through the green spring woods,
and brought back “flowers and branches.” Shakespeare,
in his “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” alluded
to the old English holiday, and declares, through the
mouth of one of his characters, that folks would not
lie abed the last day of April, but rose up early to
observe this rite of May, so eager were they for its
fun. So keenly did Queen Bess enjoy these revels
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
that she always longed, it is said, to lay aside the state
of royalty on these occasions, and live the life of a
milkmaid during the month of May.</p>

<p class='c014'>Towards the close of the Elizabethan era, Stubbs
wrote, sourly attacking all such practices. In an old
brown, mouldy book by him, that I once came across
in an old country house library, entitled “Anatomie of
Abuses,” I read a jaundiced account of a May festival.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Chiefest Jewel that they bring from the woods,”
he wrote, “is their May-poole, which they bring home
in great veneration in this wise.” And then the old
Puritan went on to recount how “tweentie to fourtie
yoke of oxen were harnessed together, and how a sweet
posie of flowers was tied to the typee of their horns,
and so the oxen drew home the May-poole.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thinking over old-fashioned customs, it was impossible
not to lament there is now left, to quote an
old chronicler’s quaint expression, “so little worshipful
mirth” in England, and that villages no longer have
their dances and May Day rejoicings, as in years gone
by. It cannot be other than a matter of regret to all
reflective minds, that the one notion of pleasure
amongst our working classes, is to sit long hours in
an excursion train, and, be it said, invariably to leave
their own homes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hospitality amongst the poor, save for a wedding
or a christening, has become a thing of the past. Love-spinning,
soul-caking, and well-dancing are all gone
by. And England is a poorer country, I think, in that
it is no longer Merrie England, as it was in the days
of the Tudors and the Stuarts, but the England of
many chimneys—in others words, the Workshop of the
World.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUMMER SOUNDS</div>

<p class='c014'>Soft days followed Easter Sunday. The weather
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
was exquisite sunshine and shower making a perfect
combination. Burbidge was always busy. There was
continually the summer sound of mowing. No longer,
alas! the rhythmic swish of the scythe, but the
twinkling click of the machine. Yet even this was
delightful, for in the sound came the cry of summer.
Everywhere the heads of the herbaceous plants in
the border grew bolder and stronger. The beautiful
burning bush, as my old gardener calls the <i>Dictamnus
Fraxinella</i>, was then a foot high; and my white
Martagon lilies and <i>Lilium Auratum</i> were all springing
up gaily from their mother earth strong and vigorous;
whilst my Oriental poppies, of various colours, were
rearing themselves up for a June glory. Then my
pansies (the seed of which I had brought from Paris a
year ago) were full of promise. How rich they will be, I
said, blotched and mottled in different shades of purple,
lavender, and chocolate brown, and each flower later
will have a face of its own, with an almost human
expression. Besides these, there were Hen and Chicken
daisies, or red and pink Bachelor’s Buttons, as they call
them in Shropshire, and opening sprays of Bouncing
Bess (which is our local name for the gay Valerian),
wherever it could push its way between the old stone
walls.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='le-caption'><i>Photo by Frith</i></p>
<p class='ce-caption'>The ABBEY RUINS.</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>I wandered round the garden in the Cloisters, with
its lavabo and wrought-iron gates. On the lancet
windows of the Leper’s Chamber, white pigeons were
cooing and disporting themselves, and running up and
down along the level turf. Jackdaws amidst the ruins
were hurrying to and fro on the wing, with grub or
insect in their beaks. Above the chamber, where men
said the service was heard by the sick, there was a
mass of gold which shone like beaten metal against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
cloudless sky. It was the wild wallflower in a sea of
blossom. How busy all nature was—building, growing,
blossoming, and budding. Certainly a fair spring
morning is one of the undying joys of the world.</p>

<p class='c014'>Later on I found myself in the little kitchen garden.
The later pears were then sheets of snow, and I noticed
that an apple flower was beginning to turn pink on an
espalier.</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge I found busily occupied in dividing the
roots of the violets.</p>

<p class='c014'>All through the winter, when frosts bound the ground,
he sent me in fragrant bunches of the double Neapolitan
violet, varied by bouquets of the Czar, the Princess of
Wales, and the red purple of Admiral Avalon.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now all the roots were being lifted from the frames,
and little runners with minute fibrous roots planted,
some eight inches apart, in shady corners.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the summer, Burbidge and his boys will cut
off every runner or blossom that may appear on these
plants, and keep them, to use his expression, “round
as a nest.” “I likes,” he said, “to give ’em hearts like
cabbages.” The first week in September, the violet
roots will be replaced in the frames “for winter blowing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the mean time the frames are to be cleared, the
soil renewed, and then sown with asters, zinnias, and
my beautiful golden lettuces, that come over every year
from the Austrian seedsman.</p>

<p class='c014'>Next to the frames, in little narrow beds, were lines
of choice daffodils, and I stopped to look at them.
They were of the largest and most effective kinds.
There was Emperor, and Empress, Horsfieldi, Sir Watkin
Wynn, Golden Spur, Mrs. Langtry, and beautiful
Madame de Graaf, and the brilliant sunset glory of
Orange Phœnix.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
They made a brave show and found great favour in
my old gardener’s eyes. “Nothing mean about they,”
he said, only the day before, complacently to me.
“Look to the size. They be near the girth of roses,
and fit for any nobleman’s garden.” The old man
seemed to swell with pride as we looked at them
together. I had not the heart to be disagreeable and
to suggest that any should be plucked for vases, or to
deck the altar bowls, and I saw that my old friend was
relieved.</p>

<p class='c014'>A little later I walked up the trim path empty-handed
and peeped into the gooseberry and currant
cages. The cages are made of fine wire netting, fixed
on poles, about twenty feet square, in which were
planted currants and gooseberries, to save their fruit
from the wild birds. Burbidge joined me. “So,” he
said, “they has nothing inside to rob them, not a
‘nope’” (as he calls the bullfinch), “nor them mischievous
‘poke-puddings’” (by which name some folks
here call the tomtits) “can interfere.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BULLFINCH CAN DO NO WRONG</div>

<p class='c014'>Hearing my favourites, the bullfinches, attacked, I
could not help saying something in their defence.
“The cock ‘nope,’ as you call him, is so beautiful,” I
urged, “that surely he may have a few buds in spring,
and later on get a little fruit? Besides,” I added
warmly, “many people now say that he does no
damage, and that the buds, that he attacks, are already
diseased, and, anyway, would bear no fruit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But at this Burbidge waxed wroth. “The nope,”
he retorted angrily, “be pure varmint for gardens,
same as stoats be for poultry, and squirrels for trees;
and as to his colour, ’tis like looks in lasses, it hath
nought to do with character. I don’t see things, marm,
as you does. When yer sweats for a thing, there be no
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
halves in the matter. What’s a friend to my garden, I
be a lover to; but what’s foreign, I be a foreigner to,”
and the old man walked away in a huff.</p>

<p class='c014'>After “our bullfinch war,” as Bess called it when I
recounted to her later the little episode, I walked up the
path that is edged by rows of double primroses. How
lovely they were in the neatest of little clumps, white,
yellow, and mauve, with here and there tufts of hen and
chicken daisies, roots of the single blue primroses,
brilliant polyanthuses, and the curious hose-in-hose
variety, which an old South Country nurse of ours used
to call “Jack-a-Greeners.” A little further on, I saw
some plants of the soft <i>Primula Cashmeriana</i>, which bore
leaves which looked as if they had been powdered with
milk of sulphur, and carried umbrella-like mauve heads
of blossom.</p>

<p class='c014'>A little higher up the path I saw some fine plants of
<i>Primula Japonica</i> with its red whorls of blossom; and
at the top of the garden I came across a line of beautiful
auriculas. The most beautiful of all the primulas, I think,
is “Les Oreilles d’Ours,” as the French call these flowers,
with their sweet distant smell, like downs covered with
cowslips on dewy mornings, or golden apricots ripening
on southern walls. As I passed back to the Abbey, I
plucked a shoot off a black-currant bush. How fragrant
the budding shoots were. They recalled the perfume of
the bog myrtle on Scottish moors, only that the scent
had something homely and useful, but none the less
delicious.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ten minutes later, and I was seated before my embroidery.
To-day I had a blue dragon to work. I tried
to see and to reproduce in my mind’s eye Burne Jones’
wonderful tints of blue with brown shades and silver
lights, and so the hours passed.</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">“A PATIENT HAS VIRTUES”</div>

<p class='c014'>In the afternoon Bess visited Thady. “Mama,” she
cried, “I think Thady will soon be well, for all he was
so lame on Sunday. You see he wants to get well so
badly, and what people want badly they generally get.
I took him some pudding and some cake, and Nana
gave him some ointment. Nana,” said Bess, presently,
“seems quite kind now. Do you know, mamsie, since
Thady has taken her medicine, and rubbed on her lily
stuff, she seems quite to like Thady.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, my little girl,” I laughed, “you are discovering
a very old truth. Nana has found a patient, and a
patient always has virtues.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess did not quite understand, but declared it was a
good job that Nana had given up disliking Thady, for in
Thady, Bess found a most delightful and useful friend.
He had already made my little maid a whistle, and was
then engaged in making her a crossbow, and he is a
wonderful hand in whittling an ash or hazel stick in
elaborate designs, all of which are delightful and rare
accomplishments in Bess’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>All the week Bess ran up and down to the Red
House. Bess repeated her verses for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> to Miss
Weldon, and gained what her governess called “word
accuracy,” but all gestures and action Constance taught
her, I heard. Besides this, I was told about the dance
which was being practised for the great day by eight
little town maidens in the disused room over the
stables of the Red House, and of the music which
Constance’s nice parlourmaid played. Constance endeavoured
to get eight little boys to dance also; but the
little lads were too shy, what an old woman, speaking of
her grandson, calls “too daffish and keck-handed to
learn such aunty-praunty antics,” and all that Constance
could get in the way of male support was to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
induce eight little lads to look on, bend their knees,
and bow at intervals, whilst the maidens sang and
danced.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess was full of her verses and of her white costume,
and old Nana, for all that she grumbled much at first,
got stage-fever at last in her veins, and told me “that
none would look as well as her blessed lamb, and seeing
what the play was, and who made the dresses, and where
the flowers grew, she held it to be all foolish, overgrown,
mealy-mouthed righteousness on old Hester’s
part to stick out so obstinate and audacious again’ a
harmless bit of childer’s play.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When I asked Burbidge if he and his men would get
me some primroses and bunches of marsh marigolds,
he was at first very wroth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do yer take me for a loseller, marm?” he said,
using the old country word for an idler. “Do yer think
that I have nought to do, but to stump through wood
and field, pulling blows for a May folly?”</p>

<p class='c014'>But since the first outbreak he softened, and now
he has begun to speak in a more kindly spirit, about
fine primroses as grow above Homer steps, marsh
marigolds as can be got near the Marsh Farm pool, and
about cuckoo pint and bits of green fern, and I have
little doubt that on May morning it will be found that
my request has been granted.</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge and Nana will always do what we want
them, only give them time, as Bess says, for my little
minx, young as she is, has long discovered that with old
friends, and particularly old servants, there is often a
great deal of bark, but happily not much bite.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day it had been raining all the morning. Everything
seemed growing. I could almost, as I looked out
of the window, see the chestnut buds swelling, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
points of the yews were turning a reddish gold. Through
a window I could hear the canaries singing, singing and
filling the garden with melodious sounds. The sun had
gently pierced the clouds at last, and here and there
faint shades of delicate blue were to be seen.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly, as I sat by the window plying my needle
and admiring the rain drops glistening like crystals in
the grass, I saw my little friend, Thady, below on the
gravel walk. “What, Thady, you here!” I cried; for
Thady, to use his mother’s expression, was all himself
again, bare-legged and as merry as a grig.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“BEGORRA, IT’S ME”</div>

<p class='c014'>“Begorra, it’s me,” replied Thady, “me myself, and
I’ve come to ask if yer will come a bird-nesting with
me, some day?” And he added, with the courtesy that
only can be found in an Irish imp, “’Twill be an honour
and a pleasure to guide yer leddyship to the rarest nests
in the country, and yer remember our talk some weeks
ago?”</p>

<p class='c014'>So, after a little parley, it was agreed that the following
day, a Saturday, if fine, we would take our luncheon
into the woods, and that Thady should climb the trees,
as we had previously proposed.</p>

<p class='c014'>We settled thus, the main point, for Thady, in his
own language, “was the best man whatever at that
sport.” “Whilst you are climbing,” I said, “we can
look for rare flowers and ferns, and find what nests we
can upon the ground.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I asked Thady a minute later what nests he knew of.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Galore,” he answered, grinning. And then proceeded
to enumerate them: “A lintie (a linnet), a green
grosbeak (greenfinch), a Harry redcap (goldfinch), a
yellow yeorling by the roadside, a scobby (chaffinch), a
lavrock (skylark), a cushie-doo (a wood pigeon), a cutty
wren (common wren), a nanny washtail (pied wagtail)
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
in the rocks, and two tom-titers of sorts. Then there be
hawks,” he called through the window, “and one by
Ippekin’s Cave as I don’t rightly know, bluish and
bigger than the wind-hover (kestrel) or the pigeon-hawk,
not to make mention of throstles and black ouzels
(blackbirds), which just jostle same as hips and haws in
October, but they’re hardly worth the point of raising
of a foot to see.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So our plans were made, and I looked forward to
spending the morrow in the budding woods. Thady
was to be our guide, but no eggs were to be taken. This
was a matter of mortification to Thady. “Sure,” he
said, on another occasion, “I thought I would have
made the little lady, this year, the prettiest necklace
that ever was strung, fine and rare, for the May dance;
and,” he added, “yer leddyship must not forget that I
have eaten of Miss Bess’s blue egg, and so glad I would
be to show her a bit of favour.”</p>

<p class='c014'>However, I succeeded in making Thady give up the
project of robbing the nests, by begging him to make
me a whistle, which, as my little daughter declares, is a
thing that might be useful to everybody—“to a lady,
to a bishop, or even to a Member of Parliament.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The next day was a day of glorious sunshine—gay
and pure—one of those rare sweet days in spring, when
it does not seem possible for “rain, or hail, or any evil
thing to fall.” Little Hals, to our joy, came over without
governess or maid, only what Bess calls “under his
own care,” which she declared was best, because there
was then no need to be naughty; and Miss Weldon, to
the joy of all, vanished for the day to Shrewsbury; so,
to quote my little girl, “all seemed happy, and everything
just pure fun.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the old church clock struck eleven we started.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
The groom boy, Fred, led Jill, the Stretton pony, bearing
a basket strapped on a saddle, which contained a simple
luncheon, and off we went into the woods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AWAY TO THE EDGE WOOD</div>

<p class='c014'>We started gaily; there were no trains to catch—always
a subject of congratulation—and we only left
word that we should be back for tea.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was true that old Nana had black prognostications
about what “that villain Thady would do” (for since
Thady was cured, her kindly interest in him had ceased).
But I laughed at her fears. “Nan,” I cried out as we
left, “we will all take care of ourselves, and even Jill
shall come back safe and sound.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We walked along the town, Bess and Hals running
in front, hand-in-hand, and Thady and I following
leisurely behind. In a few minutes we had left the
town behind us and were wandering up a lane, cut in
the lime rock, bordered with yews in places, and between
high hedgerows.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hals begged that we might begin to bird-nest
at once; but Thady, who was master of the ceremonies,
shook his head. “Best wait, begorra, for the Edge
Wood, sir,” he exclaimed; “that’s the mightiest place in
the county for all that wears feathers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So we marched on steadily to the great strip of wood
which is known in Shropshire as the Edge Wood. This
strip runs for many miles, is very precipitous in places,
and consists of groves of oaks, patches of yews here and
there, hollies—the haunts of woodcocks—and in many
parts a rough tangle of hazel is to be found. It is a
sweet wild place, little visited save by bird and beast.
In one place the woodcutters had cut for some hundred
yards, and in the cleared spaces the ground was covered
with primroses, ground ivy, and the uncurled fronds of the
lady fern—still brown and crinkly. Groups of lords and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
ladies reared themselves up amongst their sombre leaves,
and patches of dog’s mercury nodded and whispered
with their cords of green grain. Overhead, the larch in
a few branches was breaking into emerald splendour,
whilst pink tassels at the extremities trembled here and
there. Squirrels leapt into the trees and vanished at our
approach, and once or twice we heard, like a distant
curse, the rancorous guttural cry of the jay, and saw
one disappear into the undergrowth, a jewelled flash of
turquoise splendour.</p>

<p class='c014'>In a ride below, I saw a magpie hopping about, its
long green-black tail bobbing up and down on the grass.
At this sight Thady gravely took off his cap and saluted
him, saying aloud—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One for sorrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Two for mirth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Three for a wedding,</div>
      <div class='line'>Four for a birth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And then cried out in a tone of excitement, “Look out,
yer leddyship, begorra, look out for another; for it is
mirth to-day and no sorrow whatever that we must
have.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we plunged into the heart of the wood. Fred
and Jill alone kept to the path. How lush it was, that
soft moist turf in April, all teeming with moisture
and freshness—not even the driest summer sun can
parch or dry the soil of the Edge Wood. Here and there
I saw little plantations of self-sown ash amidst beds of
downy moss, and everywhere hundreds and thousands
of little infinitesimal plants, struggling for existence. As
I walked along I noted open glades, which later would
be rosy with pink campion, or purple with the stately
splendour of the foxglove. Now and then a bird flew
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
away, and I saw at intervals the white scut of a
frightened rabbit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRD-NESTING WE GO</div>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly Thady stopped before a yew tree. Hals
and Bess followed, panting and crying out eagerly,
“Where, where?” for Thady had discarded his jacket,
and in a twinkling had thrown his arms round the tree.
In a second he was aloft. “A lintie’s nest,” he whispered,
and then peered in. A minute later he called out,
“Two eggs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will you bring one down?” we said in chorus.
For all answer, Thady nodded, slipped an egg into his
mouth, and then proceeded to descend. We looked at
the little egg that Thady held out on the palm of his
hand. It was of a pale bluish white, speckled and
streaked with lines of purplish brown.</p>

<p class='c014'>After we had all peered over it, the egg was put back
solemnly by Thady.</p>

<p class='c014'>A little further on, and Thady again halted. “Here
it be, yer leddyship,” he cried, in a high treble; and
there, sure enough, looking upward, we discerned a nest
of twigs and roots. It was quite low down, and I was able
easily to lift up the children to get a peep themselves.
The little nest was lined with hair and wool stolen from
the neighbouring fields, but as yet there were no eggs.
“A nope’s (bullfinch’s) sure enough,” said Thady, dogmatically.
Then on we wandered until we paused below
a fir tree. Below the bole of the tree there was no
herbage, for the fir leaves had fallen like needles and
had pierced and stabbed the grass to death—so it was
quite bare now, not a leaf, or even a patch of moss; as
bare, in fact, as a village playground.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly we heard overhead a loud, ringing clap of
wings, and as we looked up, we saw an ill-made nest of
sticks, and two eggs, which last we could see glistening
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
inside, like two button mushrooms. For a minute I had
a vision of a big departing bird of a soft lavender grey,
and as I looked, Thady called out, “Quice,” which is the
Shropshire name for the wood-pigeon. Thady was
anxious to mount the tree and bring me down an egg
for closer inspection; but I begged him not to do so,
for the Cushat-Doos, as he tells me he has heard them
called in the North Country, are very shy birds in a wild
state, and I have been told will never return to a nest
where the hand of man has trifled with eggs or nest.</p>

<p class='c014'>I lingered, looking up at the shining round pink eggs
with the light glimmering through the twigs; and then
I mounted up the hill, which was very hard work, for both
children were a little weary and hot, and I went up the
incline, pulling both up as best I could. Mouse kept close
to my heels. She had had dark suspicions ever since
we entered the wood, and was convinced of the existence,
I felt sure, of robbers, footpads, wolves, and also of
innumerable vague dangers, and alarms.</p>

<p class='c014'>We passed a blackbird’s nest, but Thady waved his
hand in lofty disdain, and refused to pull back the bough
so that we might look at the eggs. “’Tisn’t for dirt like
that that I’ll trouble yer leddyship and the young squire
to spier round,” he exclaimed. “The black ouzel is
just a conny among feathered folk, or what blackberries
be ’mongst the fruit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady seemed to know every inch of the ground.
“It isn’t in woods or field that I forget myself,” he remarked
to me, when I commended him for his knowledge
of the Edge. “Devil a bit,” he said, “if I have
ever lost my way along, or missed a mark or forgotten
the bend of a stick; but,” he added, in a tone of contrition,
“’tis in the book larning and figures that Thady
Malone cannot always discern rightly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
At last, after much puffing and panting, we reached
the top of the hill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCOBBY’S NEST</div>

<p class='c014'>“Like enough we’ll find a scobby’s nest in the
hedge,” said Thady. Then he went on to say, “They
be wonderful builders be scobbys; ‘tight and nanty,’ as
folks say here.” And sure enough, a little further on,
fixed in a branch of blackthorn, we saw a little nest of
exquisite beauty. Outside it appeared to be built almost
entirely of lichen, pulled off the bark of trees; whilst
inside it was lined with hair and feathers, woven together
with marvellous dexterity. There were three eggs,
all of a reddish pale grey, blotched here and there with
vinous patches.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we stood watching the nest, the handsome little
cock chaffinch eyed us anxiously. With a quick movement
he turned round, and we caught the flash of his
white wings. “A bobsome, joyous little gent,” said
Thady; “a scobby, I have heard folks say, is the last
bird to give over singing in summer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we sat down to luncheon. “We must eat,”
Bess cried with conviction; “seeing so many nests has
made me feel eggy with hunger.” All round us the
birds filled the thicket with the joy of their carols.
“The place fair swarms with them,” observed Thady,
“but come a week or two, we shall have all the foreigners
over.” By which he, doubtless, meant the arrival of all
the delicious warblers that come from the South in
spring, not to mention many of the cock chaffinches,
most of the pipits, the yellow water-wagtails, the
gorgeous redstarts, and the beautiful turtle, or Wrekin
doves.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c014'>Listening to the different notes, we sat down and
got our luncheon, which Bess and Hal, who had
acquired the appetite of hunters, declared was fit for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
any king, and believed that even Nan, if she had been
there, wouldn’t grumble.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When I’m at home,” said Bess, after a pause, “I
eat mutton, but here I call it the flesh of sheep,” and as
she spoke she put upon Hal’s knees another slice. Hal
looked at her and retorted gravely, “Mutton isn’t good,
but the flesh of sheep is fit for a general.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady, overhearing these remarks, exclaimed, “Begorra,
it is a poor place where Thady Malone cannot
eat to your leddyship’s health.” And added, “Deed,
I’m like Mrs. Langdale’s chickens, I could peck a bit
wherever it was.” So saying, he fell heartily to work
on some huge beef sandwiches which had been prepared
for him and Fred, by Auguste. A few minutes later, the
girths of the saddle were loosened and Jill was allowed
to graze at her own free will, nipping and cropping the
tender grass with avidity.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mamsie,” said Bess, after the last scrap of chocolate
had been eaten, and the last Blenheim orange apple
munched, “have you no fairy-story to tell us, for you
know, this is a real place for fairy-tales.” Then the
children crept under my cloak, and I rambled on aloud
about princes and princesses, giants and dragons, enchanted
castles, good and evil fairies, and knights and
ladies.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady approached our group and listened also.
“’Tis better nor a theatre,” he was kind enough to say,
as I came to an end at last, with the happy marriage of
the prince and princess, and a description of the royal
festivities on that occasion. “Begorra,” he exclaimed,
“I’d like to be a man, and fight dragons and giants.
Fightin’ is the life for me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we got up, packed the basket, and prepared to
return homeward across the fields. Jill was caught,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
but could with difficulty be girthed, so enlarged had she
become by several hours of happy browsing; but after a
struggle the saddle and basket are put on, and we turned
our heads homewards. Hals had been silent for the
last few moments.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” I said, “what is it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I too should like to fight,” he answered, “but it
must be on a horse and in armour.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GLORY OF AULD OIRELAND</div>

<p class='c014'>“’Tis all one, sir,” replied Thady, cheerily, “so long
as yer get a stomach full of blows and can give good
knocks back. Fighting,” he explained, “is what makes
the difference between boys and girls, and it is the glory
of auld Oireland.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We talked away and walked homeward. There was
a nest of a cutty wren in a juniper bush, which Thady
knew of, and a tomtit’s in a hollow tree, beautifully
made of a mass of feathers, and in it were many tiny
eggs, almost too small to touch without breaking, and
Fred lifted both children up to see. A little further on,
Thady pointed away to a distant orchard that encircled
two lonely cottages nestling against the opposite hill.
“There,” he said, “be the nest of a Harry red-cap.”
But our energy had died away for bird-nesting. “It
shall be for another day,” said Bess. And then added
dreamily, “I didn’t think I ever could have seen bird-nests
enough, but I think some other play now would be
nice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So we walked on, Hals leading the way, and Thady
bringing up the rear and whistling, as he went along, the
Shan Van Vocht. Thus we returned home, Bess and
Hals riding on Jill in turns. The cry of the cuckoo
pursued us like a voice out of dreamland, while the
scents of the sweet spring day were wafted to us on a
hundred eddying breezes.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
In the evening I found a note from Constance at the
Abbey. She sent me a full list of the flowers she
proposed working on the quilts, and added, “What do
you think of these words about sleep?—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When I had written to Constance, I thought of bed
in a happy sleepy state of mind. As I brushed out my
hair, I went over our pleasant long day in the woods,
away from men, and noise, and even home. A day spent
amidst birds and beasts, looking at nests, resting on
mossy banks, and seeing only the sweet, sprouting
things of field and lane, is a delightful thing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Is there anything better than a day out in the heart
of the country? As I slipped into bed, Bess’s last words
came back to me as she went off to her cot. “Is it
really very wicked, mamsie, to take nests and eggs?—for
Fred says he has done it scores and scores of times,
and he doesn’t see no use in such things if they can’t
make sport for young ladies and gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Some day you will understand,” I had replied.
“One cannot know some things when one is very
young.” And I have often noticed with children, that,
up to a certain age, the uneducated view of everything
is the sympathetic and natural one; later, to a few, the
light does come.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>All the morning Bess had been beside herself, jumping
up and down, and running round in gusts of wild excitement.
At noon the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> was really to take place, and at
that hour Constance and her band were to come down
by a back way through the town. The piano had already
been moved on the bowling green, between the yew
hedges. In the distance I had watched Burbidge superintending,
and I am sure grumbling freely by the
ominous shakes of his head. Our old servant had been
in a great state of alarm about his lawns since the
dawn, and the passing of the piano under the great yew
arch had been to him a matter of grave anxiety
“They be centuries in growing, be yews,” he said
to me, “and the commonest piano as is made, can
break ’em.”</p>

<p class='c014'>However, in spite of his hostile tone, Burbidge and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
“his boys” went out quite early and brought back an
abundance of fiery marsh marigolds from the marshes,
great sprays of budding beech, and a few branches of
opening hawthorn; besides which they gathered bunches
of primroses, the last of the season that were still in
flower in damp woodlands and against northern banks,
and also purple heads of meadow orchises. “She’ll be
fine,” Burbidge told Nan, “but it be a sad waste of time
pulling wild things that come up all by themselves, when
we might have been puttin’ taters in or wheelin’ on
manure.” At this old Nan had waxed wroth and had
exclaimed, “There’s none too old to idle sometimes,
Burbidge.” “Ay,” had replied our old gardener in a
surly tone, “but let me idle in my own way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>However, for all his apparent hostility, I had an
idea at the back of my head, that Burbidge would be
concerned if the little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> did not go off well; and I
believed, in spite of his angry tones, that he and his
boys would deck the May-stang and order all rightly
for me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was not deceived, for as I looked out of the drawing-room
windows, I saw a little later the gardeners all
at work, putting up the May-pole. In a little while it
was finely decked with gay flowers, and Célestine and
Nana, for once united in a common cause, brought out
many yards of coloured ribbon, which they tied in knots
of pink, red, white, blue, and yellow amongst the
flowers. These floated like a hundred little flags in the
breeze, and seemed to fill the air with gaiety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DECKED FOR THE FÊTE</div>

<p class='c014'>When this operation was at last completed, the
dressing of Bess began in earnest, and my little maid
for once sat quite still, and allowed mademoiselle to brush
and fluff her hair till it stood out like the mane of a
Shetland pony. This done, Nana put her on a little
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
white bodice and paniers, and sewed on bunches of
primroses and white violets, and then crowned her
with a crown of golden marsh marigolds that the deft
fingers of Célestine had twisted together. “Thee’ll be
crowned, dear,” said the old nurse softly, “with the lucky
flower.” Then all the maids from upstairs and downstairs
crowded to the nursery, and Bess received me
graciously, looking like a little fairy. In her hand she
held her sceptre as May Queen, round which was wound
a sprig of ivy, and one little bunch of violets.</p>

<p class='c014'>All the time my little girl had been dressing, her
lips had never ceased to move. I asked her what was
the matter? “My verses, my verses,” was her reply.
When all was completed, and the bunches re-sewn in
places so that none could fall, Nana looked out of a
passage window. “They be all a-comin’ to see my
lamb,” she cried. And sure enough there were old men
in smocks, old beldames in quaint old black sun-bonnets,
and all the children from the National School. On they
streamed together. Then Constance and her dancers
appeared, some of them running to escape observation,
and all attired in waterproofs, so that nobody might
see the splendour of their festive apparel. The garlands
on their heads even were covered with Shetland
shawls. They had slipped down by the churchyard and
so into the ground, to try and gain unseen the back of
the great yew hedge and walnut tree.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We are all ready,” cried Constance, as we made
our way out and gained her group. I looked at her band
of children. “Some will be dancers,” she said, “in yellow
and green, some in blue, and the rest in cherry or
scarlet. Behind her little lasses stood eight little lads
in smocks, with soft felt hats, looped up with ribbons,
and each gay bachelor had a posy knot, like the bouquets
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
coachmen used to wear at a drawing-room in Queen
Victoria’s time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They will dance,” whispered Constance to me in an
aside, and pointed to her little swains, “another year,
and then the little girls will not have all the fun to
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then there was a hush, and the Shetland shawls and
the cloaks were all taken off in a jiffey, and at a signal
given, Dinah started playing on the piano. The old tune
across the lawn sounded like a far-off tinkle. Dinah made
a pretty picture. She was dressed like a village maiden
of the eighteenth century. On her head she had a mobcap,
across her shoulders was folded a fichu of lawn, and
on her hands were a pair of old black silk mittens that
belonged long years ago to Constance’s grandmother.</p>

<p class='c014'>All the people stood aside as the players and dancers
made their way to the centre of the lawn.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the singers stood by the piano and started in
unison an old May song. The sun shone forth brightly,
and a throstle joined in from a damson tree at the top
of his voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a general sense of joy. The young voices
sounded sweet and clear, and all the meadows and
distant hills seemed bathed in a blue mist.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last the singing died away. Then Bess, with
bright eyes, but somewhat nervous steps, advanced and
repeated her verses. She spoke as clearly as she could.
Nana looked at her, as if she could eat her up with pride,
and afterwards declared that Bess had spoken like an
archbishop; and even old Sally Simons, who is believed
to be deafer than any post on the estate, affirmed that
she could hear “’most every word.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Across the budding sward Milton’s beautiful verses
in praise of May seemed to ring in my ears. In the far
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
meadows, the rooks were cawing amongst the poplars,
and over the Abbey pool a few swallows were skimming
and catching flies—</p>

<div class="sidenote">“HAIL! BOUNTEOUS MAY”</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hail! bounteous May that dost inspire</div>
      <div class='line'>Mirth and youth and warm desire.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The world seemed young again—old age a myth,
and nature exceedingly fair. At last Bess’s lines were
ended, and my little maid made her curtesy and tripped
back to me. Then the dancers stepped forward and the
music broke out afresh into a merry jingle. They stood
round the May-pole, advanced solemnly and made profound
reverences. A few seconds later, the tinkling of
the piano grew quicker and quicker, for the eight little
maidens had all caught hold of each other’s hands, and
round and round they went as fast as youth and gaiety
could take them. The people clapped, and the old folks
broke forth into shrill laughter. Old Timothy beat the
gravel with his stick, till Burbidge glared at him and
muttered something disagreeable about “folks not being
able to behave themselves;” whereupon my old guest
hung his head and began to cough asthmatically.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dance pleased all so well, that Constance and
her little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps dramatique</span></i> were obliged to go through
the whole of it again. “It be better nor a ballet” said
old Timothy. “I seed one once years agone at Shrewsbury
Theatre, after the Crimean war; but this here be
dancing on the green—and not dancing for money,
but for pure joy.” So away the little dancers footed
it again. Even the little lads, who hitherto had
remained stolid and apparently indifferent, caught
something of the enthusiasm of the spectators, for at
intervals they bowed with eagerness, and pointed and
laughed at the little maidens, and ejaculated aloud,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
as they had been taught by Constance to do at the
rehearsals, “Good, good, well done, Mistress Betty;
excellently, madam,” and so on, till, as a fond mother
said, “Anybody might think as they had been born
play-actors, for they took to mumming same as widdies
(young ducks) do to water.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When all was over, and even the tinkling piano was
heard no more, Fremantle and footmen bearing trays
of cake, beer, and milk appeared on the scene. As to
the children, we made them stand in long lines on the
paths, and gave them slices of cake and buns, and drinks
of milk in the blue and white mugs of the country; but
before they fell to, they repeated in chorus the old grace
which Constance had found in praise of May merry-making.
At last, not even the youngest little boy could
eat any more, and gradually all my guests bowed and
curtsied, and left the lawn, but old Timothy who was
seized with a violent fit of coughing, leant feebly on his
stick, and looked at me piteously out of his rheumy
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“’Tis the rheumatics as has got hold of me,” he
said, between two fits of coughing. “They be terrible
companions, be rheumatics, worse than snakes nor wasps,
and allus with ’un summer and winter. Rheumatics,”
he added wheezily, “be like burrs, they hangs on to yer
all seasons.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come in for a bit,” I said, “and rest by the fire.”
Young blood is warm, but the sun hasn’t much warmth
yet. So I led old Timothy into the housekeeper’s room,
whilst kind Auguste made him on the gas stove a “bon
bouillon” and prepared for him a glass of spiced beer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can’t say, marm, why I took on like that,” said
old Timothy, humbly. “It cumed like all of a sudden,
and I shook like a leaf, and a kind of a swim-swammy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
sense mastered me, and dwang-swang, I think I should
have found myself on the turf, if you hadn’t taken me in
and comforted me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the old man spoke, I saw that some colour was
coming back into his old cheeks. He felt cheered by
his drop of broth, and when he had sipped of the warm
ale his tongue began to wag.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To-day,” he said, “put me to mind of the old
days when the world ran merrily at Wenlock, and
for the matter of that, all through the countryside.
They had holidays, they had, afore they had invented
trains, trams, and motors. There war the Wakes
proper, and the Wisheng Wells—all sports and jollity
after good work.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“ONCE I GRINNED THROUGH A HORSE-COLLAR”</div>

<p class='c014'>Then old Timothy proceeded to tell me how, in the
old times, “they used to clap up booths and have shows,
and dances. My grandam used to tell how they had
in her time Morris dancers and play-acting, and I
remember,” he continued, “a rare bit of fun. ’Twas to
grin through a horse-collar at Church Stretton. When
I war a lad,” said old Timothy, “’twas accounted a fine
thing to be able to make the horriblest face in the town—next
best to being the sweetest scraper on a fiddle
or a fine singer in a catch. I was never much of a
musician,” pursued my old guest, regretfully, “but for
downright, hugeous horror put into a human face, I
war bad to beat.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, after a pause, he went on to say, “I mind
me there war St. Milburgha’s Wake at Stoke. There
used to be pretty sports there. The lads used to come
in smocks and dance. They used to foot it sharp to
old country dances, cheery with lot of jumping, skipping,
and bobbing. Men used to say ’twas in honour of St.
Milburgha. I don’t hold to saints, as a rule,” explained
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
Timothy; “they be mostly old bones, nails, and useless
rubbish; but I draws a difference between Shropshire
and the rest, and I believes in Shropshire saints proper,
same as in my own parish church and in grandam’s
grave.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After a few minutes, the old man went on to tell me
about the Well Wakes. “Folks used to flock to ’em,”
he said. “They used to meet and have a jolly time.
There war the Beach Wake, near against Chirbury.
There they went in great numbers, and the best class
of farmers and their wives. There war a Whirl-stone
then, but on Wake Sunday it turned all by itself, Old
Jackson as sold the best ale allus used to say.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then when us could, us went to the Raven’s Bowl
and to the Cuckoo’s Cup on the Wrekin at the proper
times. God Almighty, we war taught to believe, kept they
full of water for his birds, and ’twar there that we
Shropshire lads, seventy years agone and more, used to
go and wish, when we had a mind to wed a wench—seventy
years agone,” the old man lingered over the
words, repeating them softly. “One summer mornin’ I
got up,” he continued, “when the dew was lying like
jewels on the turf and wet the grass it war so that yer
could wring it out with a cloth. I war up betimes,
and I walked, and walked till I got to the spot. There
warn’t many places in Shropshire as I didn’t know
then,” Timothy exclaimed with pride; and added with
enthusiasm, “yer gets to know the betwixts and
betweens of everything, sure enough, when yer be
earth-stopper to the hunt. Dad warn’t by trade, but
Uncle Mapp war—Peregine Mapp, as us used to call
un—as lived behind Muckley Cross and war the best
ount-catcher as ever I knowed, rat-catcher, and stoat-trapper,
and death to varmint generally. Well, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
took me on from rook scarin’ for Farmer Burnell;
I lived with he till I war twelve. They talks now of
eddication, but ’tis the eddication of wood and hill as
be the right ’un to make a man of yer.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EDUCATION OF WOOD AND HILL</div>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Timothy,” I said; and to bring him back to
his first subject, I added, “but you were telling me
about your walk to the Wrekin, and how you drank from
the Raven’s and Cuckoo’s bowls there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ay, ay, sure I was,” replied the old man, and a
gleam of light shot into his lustreless eyes. So saying
he rubbed his hands softly before the blazing logs and
went on—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, it war the longest day of the year. That
night in June, I’ve heard say, when they used to light
fires on the hill tops, and when the men used to sing,
and some of ’em used to leap through the fires and call
it Johnnie’s Watch; but the squires, when they took to
planting on the hillsides, forbid that sport, and there
war somethin’ to be said on that score, for I believe
myself it frightened foxes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, sure enough I walked, as I said, to the Wrekin
over the Severn by Buildwas Bridge, and up beyond near
Little Wenlock and through Wenlock Wood. I war
desperate sweet on Susie Langford—I hadn’t hardly
opened my mouth to her, but the sight of her remained
with me, night and day, same as the form of a good horse
does to a young man who can’t afford to buy him—and
I stood on the heights of the great hill, and I drank out
of the bowls and wished and wished, and made sure as I
should get my heart’s desire, for grandam had allus
said, ‘Him as goes to the Wrekin on midsummer morning,
gains his wish as sure as a throstle catches a worm
on May morning.’ Them, her used to say, ‘as goes to
the Wrekin on the May Wakes, gets nought but a jug of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
ale and a cake.’ Well, I think I got nought but water,
and never a cake that mornin’, for little the wish or the
bowls did for me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you mind very much?” I asked, watching the
shadow that swept over his face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did I mind?” replied old Timothy, vehemently.
“Some three months arter, when they told me that Susie
war agoin to marry the miller in the Dingle, I laid me
down on the cold ground in the old Abbey Church, and
thought I should have died of the pure howgy misery of
the whole job. Grandam she gave me all she could to
comfort me. I got thin as a lath—she gave me can-doughs
and flap-jacks and begged apples to slip into
dumplins, off the neighbours; and her brewed me a
drop of beer from the water from the church roof. But
it warn’t nothing to me, yer can’t comfort a man by his
stomach, when he be in love.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Anton Ames war a hugeous fellow and one of the
best with fist or gloves, or I’d have killed ’un,” broke out
old Timothy, “for he seemed to poison the whole
countryside for me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you got over her loss at last,” I ventured to say,
“though you have never married.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“One do,” replied the old man grimly. “There be
a time for everything—for women, for posy knots,
dancing, and all the kickshaws. They be all toys, mere
toys. ’Tis only sport and beer as lasts.” As he spoke
the old man looked gloomily into the fire and warmed
his wrinkled hands afresh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And Susie?” I could not refrain from asking;
“what happened to her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her married and reared a pack of childer,”
answered Timothy, “and when Anton fell off his cart
one dark night from Shrewsbury Market, they said her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
cried, but cried fit to wash away her eyes. But
her got comforted in time—they mostly do, does
women; and then, after a bit, her took a chapman.
They often do, for number two I’ve noticed,” continued
Timothy, meditatively; “for chapmans have ready
tongues, and be oily and cheeky in one. And Sue her had
a bit of siller, and they married sharp off, at Munslow
Church, I heard, and Sue her used to go hawking with
Gipsy Trevors, as they called ’im, and they used to pass
through Bridgenorth, Stretton, and up by Ludlow, same
as if her had never been born respectable or had rubbed
bright an oak dresser, or swept a parlour carpet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What did you do at the Wakes, and how long did
they last?” I asked as old Timothy relapsed into
silence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD SHROPSHIRE PLEASURES</div>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, they was most part a week,” answered the
old man. “There war too much fun then in folks, to
let the fun die out so quick as it does now. Now, if a
squire has a cricket-match, ’tis all over in no time. Piff-paff
like a train through a tunnel. There’s nought now
but a smack, and a taste of jollity, and it dies with daylight.
When I was a boy, it was altogether different.
Us could work, and us could play, and us liked to take
our fill, same as young bullocks on spring grass. Us
used to dance and sing, run races, and jump for neckties
and hat-bands, and play kiss-in-the-ring, and manage,”
said old Timothy, with a twinkle in his eye, “to stand by
a pretty lass then, and to wrestle and box besides.
They war merry times.” And here his voice sank
almost to a whisper, “And then there was cock-fightin’.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cock-fightin’?” I enquired. “Have you ever seen
much of that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lord love yer!” retorted Master Theobalds, with
kindly contempt. “Of course I have, and a prettier,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
more gentlemanly sport I b’aint acquainted with. I
mind me of the good old time, when every squire had
his own main of cocks, and many war the farmers as had
a good clutch, and great war the pride of the missus in
rearin’ a good ’un round the Clee, and over at Bridgenorth.
Folks used to say at Ludlow, as there were
some as thought more of their cocks, than of their own
souls. Why, marm, when I war a little un, we should
have thought a town a poor benighted one-horse place
as hadn’t got its cock-pit. There used,” continued old
Timothy, “to be a fine place beyond what is now the
vicarage, where they used to fight ’em regularly on Easter
Monday, and at the May Fair at Much Wenlock. Every
serving-man as had a touch of sport in his blood used to
get leave to go ‘cocking,’ as they called it then, and a
right merry sport it war, sittin’ fine days on the spring
grass, and seeing two game uns go tooth and nail for
each other.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did they put spurs on them?” I asked the old
man.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course they did, and weighed ’em.” And then
old Timothy added, “Scores of times I’ve put on the
spurs myself to oblige a squire, or a kindly farmer as had
given me a jog back from the meet, or a lift on, when I
war searchin’ after a terrier.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was there not a belief that a cock hatched in an
owl or magpie’s nest was sure to have luck in the
ring?” I asked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COCKFIGHTS OF THE PAST</div>

<p class='c014'>“Sure there war,” answered Timothy, with conviction.
“I remember hearin’ of one, Owen by the Clee, as
had a cock that he allus swore had been reared by an
owl; and Davies, near Munslow, had a famous green-tailed
bird, that he used to say was hatched in a pie’s
nest. I cannot say for sure how it war,” said the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
man, “but sartain I be that them war the two best birds
as ever I seed—let ’em be reared as they might be. They
war two upstanding birds, tall in the leg, long, lean heads,
and born game. No white feather in they. There war
many,” continued the old man, “who tried to get luck
in all ways, and stopped at nothing. Some gave ’em
chopped beef afore fightin’, and many beat up an egg
in their meal to give ’em courage and strength. And
then”—and here old Timothy paused—“there war other
ways.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What ways?” I asked with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” and my old guest sank his voice to a
whisper, “there war some on Easter Sunday as took the
Sacrament, as took it at no other time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what had that to do with cock-fighting?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, jist this,” and Timothy’s voice became hardly
audible. “They drank the wine, but saved the bread, for
some believed that a cock that had eaten consecrated
bread afore he went into the ring, war bound to win, as
the devil fought for ’im himself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What a horrible sacrilege!” I could not refrain
from exclaiming.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s what folks wud say now,” agreed Timothy,
complacently; “but there war many as didn’t feel that
then. Times be different. It war wrong, I suppose,” he
added, “but the sport war that strong in Shropshire
men then, they wud ha’ raced angels for pence and
fought with Bibles, if so be folks would have laid
on bets.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But after a pause, he added, “They didn’t all go
that far; some only bought dust from church chancels
that they threw on their bird’s feathers, or chucked a
pinch into the bags, and there never came no harm
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
from that, for it gave the sextons and vergers a lucky
penny, and made use of what otherwise would have
been let lie on the midgeon heap. And even parsons
didn’t themselves interfere there, ’cause the practice
made sextons and church officials easy to find as nuts
in the Edge Wood.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I turned, and asked the old man about old
Squire Forester’s hounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ay, they war grand ones.” And my old guest’s
eyes flashed with enthusiasm. And then old Timothy
went on to ask me if I had ever heard of Tom Moody,
“as great a devil as ever rode a horse. There war none
to beat Tom—Tom war whipper-in, and then huntsman,
and bred a rider. One day he rode, as a little lad, an
ugly cob with a pig-bristled mane. Somehow Tom hung
on, jumped with the best, and never fell, though the
leps that day, they said, were hugeous. I never seed
Tom myself,” continued Timothy, “but grandam war
his own cousin right enough, and it war a proud
moment for any lad to clasp hands with old Tom.
There war many then less proud to know a bishop or a
peer, than to know Tom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The old squire, when he seed the lad ride like that,
said at the finish—</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Will you come back and whip in for me, for yer be
the right sort?’</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Will I, yer honour? Sure I will,’ said Tom, and
his ugly mug broke out like May blows in sunshine, a
friend standing by told us. Tom and the squire they
never parted till Tom war buried under the sod of
Barrow churchyard.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Up and down dale, war Moody’s way. Nothing
lived before him. He never stopped for hedge or ditch.
Often ’tis told of ’im that he used to take guests of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
squire’s back to Shifnal, where they met the coach for
London. Then Tom would drive his prime favourite
in the yellow gig. He counted his neck for nothing,
and didn’t set no store on theirs, and they did say he
would lep pikes and hedges same as if he war hunting,
and never injured tongue of buckle or stitch of a strap.”</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c014'>“Was that possible?” I exclaimed in amazement.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lor bless yer, mam, everythin’ war possible with
Tom. They said here he war a devil incarnate on a
horse, or in his shay, and nothing could stop him. Folks
said he loved his old horse better than his soul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What was the name of his horse?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“OLD SOUL” TO RIDE</div>

<p class='c014'>“‘Old Soul,’ right enough,” answered Timothy; “a
great lean beaste, sixteen hands and more. Any
amount of bone and not a square inch of flesh, with a
docked tail and a wicked wall eye. He kicked and bit,
did Old Soul, as if he war the great Satan himself; and
I’ve heard ’em say at the kennels, that there war none
but Tom and one other man about the place as dared
go near him to dress him down, for he would savage
any one when he had a mind. Heels up, and ears back,
and his eye the colour of a yule log at Christmastide,
those were his ways. Yet Tom at covert side thought
mountains of him. ‘Old Soul and I must get to heaven
together,’ he used to say, ‘for what the old chap wud
do without me, or I without he, ’twould puzzle me to
think. And ’tis the wickedest, cutest old devil that ever
man sat across,’ Tom used to swear, ‘but if a man’s
got a spice of the true hunter in him, he blesses God to
be on such a horse when hounds be running, devil or
no devil.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Once,” continued Timothy, “I heard as Tom war
lost. They hunted for ’un everywhere down beyond
Kenley, where they had been in the morning. In those
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
days the country there war very marshy in the winter
time, for there wasn’t a bit of draining. Well, I’ve
heard it said as Tom went in, and it happened in this
way. Tom war leading his horse, but the horse war
wiser than Tom, for feelin’ the ground shaky, he jerked
up his head sudden like, and snapped the bridle and got
away. Tom, he tried to leap out of the bog, but he
couldn’t, for sure he war sucked in and kept fast prisoner
in the clay.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When the squire and the pack got back to the
kennels there war no Tom. ‘Hullo! where be Tom?’
cried the squire, and he got anxious, for never in the
born days of man had Tom not turned up. They called
and they sent out riders, and they shouted like scholards
out on a holiday, but nothin’ of Tom could they hear.
So out the squire and the faithful hunt they set, with a
fresh pack, and fresh horses, and only a lick down of
somethin’ to keep the soul in ’em. On they went, the
squire leadin’ like a lord on his white-legged chestnut.
Only this time it warn’t no fox-hunting, but a man as
they war searchin’ after.</p>

<p class='c014'>“On they rode across Blakeway, beyond Harley, then
turning straight westwards they got to the wild country,
and they rode round, I’ve heard say, almost to Church
Stretton, up to the foot of the Caradoc; and sure enough,
just as the squire war about to give up the job and creep
home to get a bit of supper, and get dogs and men to
their beds, they heard, as I’m a Christian man, somethin’
a-croaking and calling ‘Tally-ho! tally-ho!’ but so
hoarse, and strange, and misty-like, that it seemed no
real voice, but whispers from a ghost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MIDNIGHT CHASE</div>

<p class='c014'>“One of the whipper-ins, a small white-haired little
chap as they used to call ‘Soap,’ because he looked so
clean and peart, and was a pet-like with the lasses, began
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
to shiver and call out ‘Lord ’a mercy, let’s hunt the fox,
but leave alone devils and Herne the Hunter, and such
like.’ But the squire, he never turned a hair, and he
called out, ‘No bed, or rest for me till we’ve found Tom,’
and he rode on on his chestnut; and then Jack Pendrell,
what was a groom, he called out too, ‘Where the squire
goes, I go,’ and he set spurs into his grey; and then
they followed on, hounds and men, like a covey of partridges.
And all of a sudden, I have heard ’em say (for
it war the talk of the country-side for many days), Old
Dancer gave a whimper and then Regent followed suit,
and then Butterfly and Skylark threw in their bell notes,
and away the whole hunt burst like steam. They barely
seemed to touch the ground, but ran like mad, as hounds
do in a killing scent. The squire fairly split the chestnut,
Tom Trig and Bob Buckson followed close behind,
and they rode as if the devil was at their heels. And all
the while the voice kept calling, hullooing like a spirit
in a tomb, only fainter and fainter—a kind of unearthly
screech like a raven dooming a Christian across a churchyard.
At last two hounds ran in, and the squire leapt
from his horse, which steamed like a chimney, and there
they found Tom sucked up in the ground fit to die, and
the wind pretty nearly out of his body. He looked like
a ghost when they got him out. He must have perished
long before, he told ’em, if it hadn’t been that he had
found a stout handful of grass by which he had hung on,
and called for his life.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, the long and the short of it was, when they
hauled him out—which they did by ropes and knotting
their handkerchiefs together—they put him on an old
dun pony. But Tom war that silly and faint, that they
had to tie him on to keep him from falling, and so they
got him home.</p>

<p class='c014'>

“When they got back to Willey, the squire had him
taken straight to his own bed, and clapt inside. ‘Tom,’
he said, ‘don’t yer die; yer drink and yer bain’t worth
much, but fox-hunting in Shropshire can’t live without
yer.’ And,” continued old Timothy, “Tom declared
then he felt fit to die of glory at the thought as he, Tom,
and fox-hunting war one and the same thin’ in Shropshire.
Well, Tom got round, for all his chill and
lying in the ground six mortal hours, but he never war
the same man again. The squire spared no expense on
him, and made him take the same medicines as he took
himself, and gave him foreign wines, though they do
say as Tom would have liked old ale better.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“When did old Tom die at last?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot precisely remember, but I’ve heard it war
in 1796 or thereabouts. He war no great age, but he
had lived fast and went to bed mellow, as fellows used
to do then. Well, ma’am, when the doctor gave up hope,
it wasn’t long as Tom was ill, for once out of the saddle
he hadn’t much to live for, as I’ve heard ’em say. The
days seemed mortal long to Tom, lyin’, as he said, mute
as a log and nothing to interest ’im but the goin’ out
and the comin’ home of the hounds. When Tom had
made up his mind that he warn’t long for this world, he
begged the squire to step down.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Squire,’ he said, ‘I’ve been a sinner, and God
forgive me; not of much good to nobody save on a
horse, but I’ve hunted to please you and to please
myself.’ And they say that the old squire, when he
heard Tom talk like that, spoke very gentle and pitiful,
and he said, taking Tom’s hand, ‘Tom, my man, yer
don’t owe me nothin’. You’ve been a right good servant,
gone like the devil, and loved the hounds like yer
brothers.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HUNTING FUNERAL</div>

<p class='c014'>“‘Right, squire, right,’ answered Tom. And then
he told him what war in his mind about his berrial.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s some as like it one way and some another,”
said old Timothy, “but Tom he’d set his mind on a
hunting funeral. The hounds war to be in at the death,
as he called it, and the good men who rode hard and
straight war to be there too, and give a view holloa
after parson had said the prayers. Would parson mind?
Tom had asked. But the squire told ’im not to vex hisself,
for the parson war of the right sort, and would
understand that fox-hunting and the Church war both
the glory of Englishmen. Then he asked, did Tom,
that his favourite old horse, him as he had called Old
Soul, was to follow behind ready saddled as for a day’s
hunting. And then, when all was settled to Tom’s mind,
he and the squire shook hands and said good-bye to
each other. The squire,” continued my old guest,
“war a right proper man, masterful but kind, knew his
own mind, but war faithful to them as had been faithful
to him, and what he promised Squire George allus did.
He was iron as to promises—said little, but stuck to a
promise as if it had been the last word of his mother,
folks said. So in November, a matter of a few days
after poor Tom had died, they buried him accordin’
to his instructions, and all the good fellows that had
followed the hunt, and seen him show them rattling
sport fine days and foul days alike, came from far and
near to do him honour. And when they shouted, after
lowering Tom’s coffin, there war no irreverence in the
job whatever. People now,” continued Timothy, “don’t
understand sport. They think ’tis only fit stuff for a
daily paper, and mayn’t come nohow to church or touch
Church goings on. Oh, but Lord love yer!”—and my
old friend drew himself up straight in his chair—“they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
thought different then, and they gave Tom a view
holloa, for all they were worth, did the hunt, and stood
there reverent and pious over his grave bareheaded
alongside, till the woods and hills fair rang with their
voices. No harm,” said my old friend, “war meant,
and no harm war done, for God Almighty wouldn’t
make foxes if he didn’t hold to fox-chasing.” As he
spoke, Master Theobalds got up. “Good-bye, marm, and
thank you kindly,” he said. “It does me good to talk
of the old days and of the old goin’s on. It kind of
brings back a bit of sun to me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As he spoke the old man rapped his stick feebly along
the old cement floor of the monks and crept out of the
door. My big dog looked after him and growled, for
the tapping of a stick is a thing that few dogs can
stand.</p>

<p class='c014'>What strong men for good or ill, I argued, they
were, those men who saw the end of the eighteenth
and the birth of the nineteenth century. How brave
and undaunted! They fought England’s quarrels over
Europe, and they died in Spain, and won on the
plains of Waterloo. How narrow they were, how intolerant,
and how brave! Surely fox-hunting taught
them some of their endurance and courage, and the
long days over woodland and moor gave them strong
muscles and brave hearts, and prepared them for the
hardships of war.</p>

<p class='c014'>The morning, with its glory of sunshine had passed,
and the afternoon had grown grey and still. The joy of
the morning seemed hushed, a chill grey sky was
overhead, and the lowering clouds promised, a wet night.</p>

<p class='c014'>I wandered out and walked amongst the ruins. Outside
the grounds I heard a dog faintly barking, and the
faint murmur of children’s voices reached me, but as in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
a dream; all the laughter and the gaiety of May morning
had fled. I noticed that the thorns were bursting
into blossom, and that a white lilac was covered with
snow-like flowers.</p>

<p class='c014'>I passed into the Chapter House. Alas! in the nineteenth
century one complete set of arches had fallen, but
the beautiful interlaced arches were still there, although
every saint had been knocked off his niche and destroyed
by the hooligan of Henry VIII.’s or Elizabeth’s reign.
On the northern side, says tradition, reposed the body
of St. Milburgha.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOLY ONE AND MIRACLES</div>

<p class='c014'>I felt in the grey evening as if I was standing on
holy ground. It was here, according to William of
Malmesbury, the historian monk, “that there lived
formerly a very ancient house of nuns. The place
(Wenlock),” he tells us, “was wholly deserted on account
of the Danes having destroyed the fabric of the nunnery.
After the Norman conquest, Roger de Montgomery
filled the monastery with Clugniac monks, where
now,” wrote the pious monk, “the fair branches of
virtue strain up to heaven. The virgin’s tomb was
unknown to the new-comers, for all the ancient monuments
had been destroyed by the violence of the foemen
and time. But when the fabric of the new church was
commenced, as a boy ran in hot haste over the floor,
the grave of the virgin was broken through, and disclosed
her body. At the same time a fragrant odour
of balsam breathed through the church, and her body,
raised high aloft, wrought so many miracles that floods
of people poured in thither. Scarcely could the broad
fields contain the crowds, whilst rich and poor together,
fired by a common faith, hastened on their way. None
came to return without the cure or the mitigation
of his malady, and even king’s evil, hopeless in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
hands of the leech, departed before the merits of the
virgin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As I stood on the well-shorn turf, the holy scene
seemed to come back to me; then, later, the crowd of
devout pilgrims overflowing fields and common. I
seemed almost to see the bands of eager devotees, to
hear their outburst of faith and thanksgiving, and to
feel them near. I imagined cripples cured, the blind
returning with their sight, all relieved and all blessing
the Giver of life and health in their strong belief of the
eleventh century.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Arnold Forster, in her admirable work on
“Church Dedications,” declares that the little leaden
geese sometimes dug up in London are the same images
that were bought by pilgrims and taken back to their
homes from Wenlock.</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1501, by order of Henry VII., a splendid shrine
was built for the bones and relics of St. Milburgha, but
after the dissolution of the monasteries, the mob broke
in and robbed the tomb of its jewels, and scattered the
saint’s bones and ashes to the winds.</p>

<p class='c014'>I thought of all the old stories connected with the
place, of the many deeds of piety of the Saxon saint
and of her tomb, then of the rough usage of her shrine,
and of the demolition of the churches after the
Reformation.</p>

<p class='c014'>The last twenty years has brought great changes,
and none are greater than the changes in many of our
views respecting the Reformation. No longer a narrow
Protestant spirit governs us, or makes us believe that
all done at the Reformation was well done, and for the
glory of God. We mourn over the ruined churches, the
deserted altars, and the loss to the world of so much
that was venerable and beautiful.</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAINTS WERE DRIVEN FORTH</div>

<p class='c014'>Bishop Godwin lamented bitterly over the fall of the
monasteries. “Godly men,” he wrote, “could not
approve of the destruction of so many grand churches
built,” as the bishop expressed it, “for the worship of
God by our ancestors. It was deeply to be regretted,”
he declared, “the diversion of such an amount of ecclesiastical
revenues to private use, and the abolition of
every place where men might lead a religious life in
peace, and retirement from worldly business, devoting
themselves wholly to literary toil and meditation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Till the reign of Henry VIII. England was studded
over with beautiful church buildings and monuments.
They were centres of learning and culture. Buildwas,
the great Cistercian monastery only three miles away,
on the banks of the Severn, was famous in the Middle
Ages for its workshops, and for the many copies of the
Scriptures which were penned there, whilst in many of
the monasteries, as even Lord Herbert said, the brothers
behaved so well “that not only were their lives exempt
from notorious faults, but their spare time was bestowed
in writing books, in painting, carving, graving, and the like
exercises, so that even their visitors became intercessors
for their continuance.” But Cromwell would not allow
the monks any virtues, and declared brutally that their
houses should be thrown down to the foundations, and
continued to fill the king’s coffers and his private purse
with their gold.</p>

<p class='c014'>Camden wrote: “Up to the thirty-sixth year of Henry
VIII.’s reign, there were six hundred and forty-five
religious houses erected for the honour of God, the propagation
of Christianity and learning, and the support
of the poor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then,” says the historian, “a storm burst upon the
English Church, like a flood, breaking down its banks,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
which, to the astonishment of the world and the grief
of the nation, bore down the greater part of the religious
houses, and with them their fairest buildings.</p>

<p class='c014'>“These buildings were almost all shortly after
destroyed, their monastic revenues squandered, and the
wealth which the Christian piety of the English nation
had from their first conversion dedicated to God, was in
a moment dispersed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After doing away with the smaller monasteries,
Henry VIII. found himself and the State but little
richer for the confiscations. The story runs that he
complained bitterly to his minister, Cromwell, of the
rapacity of his courtiers, and is said to have exclaimed
angrily—</p>

<p class='c014'>“By our Lady! the cormorants, when they have got
the garbage, will devour the fish.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is more to come, your grace,” answered the
wily vicegerent.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tut, tut, man,” the king is supposed to have
answered, “my whole realm would not stanch their
maws.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Great was the sorrow of the poor at the dissolution.
For the monks, as a rule, had been kind masters. They
had nursed the sick, and had given away many doles at
Christmas and welcome charities. They had fed and
had clothed the indigent, and had opened their houses
often as places of rest to travellers and to those in
distress.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was,” wrote Strype, “a pitiful thing to hear the
lamentations that the people of the country made for
the monasteries. For in them,” he asserts, “was great
hospitality, and by the doing away of the religious
houses, it was thought more than 10,000 persons,
masters and servants, had lost their living.”</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">LATIMER’S PLEA</div>

<p class='c014'>Even Latimer, strong, sturdy Protestant that he was,
though he flamed with righteous wrath at the abuses
that went on in many of the religious houses, prayed that
some of the superior and blameless houses might be
spared. It was not wise, he thought, to strike all with
one sweeping blow, and he begged “that some of the
monasteries might continue and be filled with inmates
not bound by vows, and revised by stringent statutes,
where men in every shire might meditate and give
themselves up to holy prayer, and acquire the art of
preaching.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That soul must be low indeed,” wrote Cobbett, in
his “History of the Protestant Reformation,” “which is
insensible to all feelings of pride in the noble edifices of
its country.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Love of country, that variety of feelings which
all together constitute what we properly call patriotism,
consists in part, of the admiration and of veneration
for ancient and magnificent proofs of skill, and of
opulence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The monks built, as well as wrote, for posterity.
The never-dying nature of their institutions set aside
in all their undertakings every calculation as to time
and age. Whether they built, or whether they planted,
they set the generous example of providing for the
pleasure, the honour, the wealth and greatness, of
generations upon generations, yet unborn. They
executed everything in the best possible manner. Their
gardens, their fish-ponds, farms; in all, in the whole
of their economy they set an example tending to make
the country beautiful—to make it an object of pride
with the people, and to make the nation truly, and
permanently great.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Full of these different thoughts, I walked beneath
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
arch and column, and so away from the old world and
its belongings, until I stood before my aviary of
canaries. I entered the cage. As I watched my birds
I heard a pitter-patter overhead, and, looking up, I saw,
leaning against a rail, my little friend Thady Malone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, Thady,” I said, “what has brought you
here? I missed you this morning during the May
Dance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“’Deed,” said Thady, slowly, “it was sorry I was
not to be wid you, for I hear the little leddy danced like
a cat in the moonlight, and shone like a glow-worm at
the point of day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, but Bess didn’t dance,” I answered laughing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, ’deed, if she had,” replied Thady, enthusiastically,
“there’s not a fairy in auld Oireland that would
have kept pace with her, or looked half the darlint.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have it your own way, Thady,” I said, for I knew
that Thady had long since kissed the Blarney Stone.
“And now tell me why you didn’t come. There were
cakes, and singing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My mother,” answered Thady, solemnly. “It was
my mother that was the prevention of my best intentions.
My mother,” he continued, “is as full of pride as an
egg is full of meat. And ‘Thady,’ she said, in a voice
as deep as death, yer leddyship knows her way of
speakin’, ‘’yer must never,’ she said, ‘give the name
of your father a downfall. When yer go to her leddyship’s
sports it must be clad as the best of ’em,’ and
where were my boots to begin with?” And Thady
sighed, and looked down rather piteously at his bare
feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>But a minute later, with the grace of an Irish lad,
his face became wreathed in smiles, and he turned to
me saying, “Well, though I stayed at home I gave yer
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
all the good wishes in the world, and as I couldn’t be
here in the morning, ’tis here I am in the evening.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I stepped out of the aviary, and, as I mounted
the stairs, I noted that Thady’s face had an air of
mystery. As I approached him, he held out something
in his hand, and said, in a tone of charming apology,
“Here is something I have for yer, and for yourself
alone. It’s never dirt with yer leddyship, whatever it
is that a poor lad brings yer,” and as I got near, Thady
uncovered one hand, and I saw through the fingers of
the other a little black bird.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“A JACK SQUEALER, BEGORRA”</div>

<p class='c014'>“A jack squealer, begorra,” he exclaimed triumphantly,
as I reached the same level that he was on. Then
Thady went on to say that he had picked him up last
night. “He’s tired with coming,” he explained, “poor
bit of a bird, but if yer can keep him safe for a day
or two, he’ll live to fly with the best over crypt and
arch.” So Thady and I bore away our prize, and
mounted to the old chamber, which is known as the
leper’s room, and there we deposited our little feathered
friend.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’ll do here,” said Thady, “no cat can get him
here. Give him a dish of water, and he’ll catch flies
for himself.” The little bird was of a dusty black, with
faint green reflections, and with a light drab tint beneath
his beak, but with no white whatever under the tail.
His short face expressed no fear at human contact.
His legs I noted were very short. I put him down on
the powdery dust of the chamber. He did not attempt
to fly away, but when I placed him against my dress,
he ran up my shoulder, to quote Thady’s words, “as
active as a rabbit in a field of clover.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’s a late un,” said Thady, contemplating his
little prize. “‘Last to come, first to go,’ I’ve heard ’em
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
say about swallows, but I don’t know if ’tis true or not;
but he’s pretty in a way, and doesn’t know what fear is.”
Then Thady went on to say nobody hurts a squealer,
not even Wenlock boys, even <em>they</em> let him be. He’s the
Almighty’s prime favourite, after a wren or a cock
robin, Thady gave as an explanation. Then he told
me how he found him at the bottom of the Bull Ring
last night.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tired he was,” continued Thady, “like a tired
horse that had taken three parties to a wedding. So
I took him up safe from the cats; and old Timothy, him
as they call Maister Theobalds, he said, leaning on his
stick and his smock floating behind him like a petticoat,
‘Let the lady of the Abbey have ’im. Varmint and such
toys be all in her line. She or the lady Bess wull be
sure to like ’im.’ So I brought ’im here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is most fascinating,” I answered, watching my
new pet; “but how can I catch him flies?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let him be,” answered Thady; “feeding birds is
mostly killing ’em. With water he’ll freshen up, and
go and get his own meat.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stood a few minutes watching the little bird. He
ran about on the floor, and apparently found what was
necessary for his subsistence; but his wings were so
weak that he could not rise. Thady disappeared for
a moment, and then reappeared with an armful of
branches. “These will be a pleasure to him and harbour
insects, and such birds like shade. Now he’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We arranged the boughs, and Thady fetched a saucer
of water, which he put down. The bird, after a moment’s
hesitation, plunged in, expanded his wings with a cry of
pleasure, and then lay contentedly on the ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’ll be well now,” said Thady, “well as Uncle
Pat’s pig when it got into an orchard of cider apples.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
So we shut the old door of the leper’s chamber carefully
behind us, and descended the steps—overgrown with
budding valerian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRESH NESTS TO SEE</div>

<p class='c014'>“They be wonderfully dressy, be swallows,” piped
Thady, “in the building of their nests. There’s nought
that comes amiss to them. Shreds of gauze, scraps of
muslin, bits of mud, in fact,” he added, “any iligant
thing that they can meet with, they dart off with in a
minute. ’Tis wonderful the fancy and the invention of
the craythures. In August they’ll go, this sort; but where
they go there’s few as knows.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was about to return to the Abbey, when Thady
stopped me. “I’ve somethin’ else to show you, somethin’
as you’ll be pleased wid,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A real pretty bird,” was Thady’s answer. “None
of yer common kinds. The cock is the bonniest little
fellow I have ever seen; fire snaps, I call ’em,—that’s the
name that Ben O’Mally called one that we saw together
near Birmingham. He’s about the size of a robin, but
’tis a more spirited tail that he has, a black waistcoat,
and a lavender head. None of your mud-pie midgeon
tits, but a real gay hopper. About the bonniest little
fellow that I have ever seen. He’s got a flash of
brightness about him, like the foreign flower that Mister
Burbidge declared he would whip the life out of me if I
touched. Jump the flame, the blazer, and kitty brantail,
I’ve heard him called in different places; but call
’em what they will, they all think a lot of him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I asked Thady about the plumage of the little
hen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, the missus,” answered Thady. “Well she’s
purty but not so fine as her mate. She’s a bitter duller,
and the fire has gone out of her tail.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
“Where is the nest?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady did not answer, but walked across the ruined
church to a broken column, and there, sure enough,
in a little hole screened from the winds by a spray of
budding eglantine, I found the nest of the redstart.
The eggs, of which there are four, reminded me of those
of the hedge-sparrow; but the blue was fainter, and on
one or two I noticed a few dim brownish specks. Then
we retired quickly, for hovering close by was the brilliant
little cock bird himself. How beautiful he was! Like a
vision of the tropics. The redstart is never found in great
numbers in Shropshire, but every year there is a pair
that comes and builds somewhere in our ruined church.
Three years ago they built in a wall, last year in a crevice
in the crypt, and this year in a ruined column.</p>

<p class='c014'>The redstart visits our shores in April, and always
commands attention by his brilliant plumage. He is a
bold bird and not easily frightened. He dips his tail up
and down, with a movement which recalls that of a water-wagtail,
only it is not so fussy, or continuous; and when
he flies, he leaves behind him the vision of a red-hot coal
on the wing, so glorious are the feathers on the top of
the tail.</p>

<p class='c014'>I begged Thady to show no one the nest. Nests
are best kept dead secrets, and this one, I said, will be a
joy and an interest to me for the next two months.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve somethin’ more,” and Thady hesitated—“and
a real beauty,” he added. “I know yer was occupied with
play-acting and entertainments and what not,” and
Thady waved his hand majestically, as if on May
morning of 1904 ours had been the revels of Kenilworth,
and added “it isn’t beasts, and birds, that the gentry
care for at such times, so I waited my time,” and Thady
beckoned to me to follow.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
I crossed the garden, and let myself out by the lily
gates while Thady stepped over the wall, and found
myself in a few minutes’ time across the meadows and
standing with Thady by the furthest point of the old
Abbey fish-ponds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RING-OUZEL’S NEST</div>

<p class='c014'>“’Tisn’t often as this sort will come down from the
hills and the wild ground,” Thady said. “They are wild
folk and belong to the north moorland. I’ve never heard
of a rock-jack here. Some folks call ’em burn-dippers.”
I looked, and saw amongst the branches of an old willow
a nest which was not unlike that of a blackbird, but the
eggs were not quite the same, being splashed with spots
of a reddish brown on a ground of a brighter green.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it?” I asked, for Thady’s country names
did not convey much to me. And then I saw, not far off
on the grass, a bird not unlike the familiar blackbird, or
black ouzel of the garden, as some country folks still
call him, save that he had a white throat. It was the
first that I ever saw in England, although I believe the
ring-ouzel is not uncommon on the Church Stretton hills;
but on cultivated land, save in a few parts of Scotland,
he is always a rare visitor.</p>

<p class='c014'>I watched him hop about, with the same heavy
flop of his cousin, the blackbird, but I noted that his
plumage was not so brilliant as our garden favourite.
He had greener shades in the black, and his plumage
was almost of a rusty brown in places. Underneath his
throat he had a brilliant white tie. He was certainly a
handsome fellow. His movements recalled those of a
blackbird, but he had not the “yellow dagger” that
Tennyson praised, and at our approach he did not make
his exit with the angry rattle which is so characteristic
of our garden friend.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, Thady,” I said, “I am pleased. The ring-ouzel
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
is a very rare English bird. At least, so they say
in books.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Begorra, I have never seen one in these parts but
once,” answered Thady, “and that was in Sherlot
Forest by the lake.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we got back over the rails, and I followed
Thady to one of the small plantations where the young
trees were about twenty years old.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What else have you got?” for Thady was beginning
to run, so great evidently was his impatience to show
me something that he knew of.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A nest of the finest singer in Shropshire,” replied
Thady, “as good, some say, as the nightingale. I’ve
heard him called the mock nightingale, and by others
the coal tuft, Jack smut, and black the chimney.
Anyway, whatever they like to call him, he’s a fine
songster for all his poor dull feathers. He can pipe
loud and full right across a wood, and then warble soft
as a nope’s bride. He won’t stay here in August, and
flies away with the first of the swallows.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I recalled the olive woods in Southern France,
and remembered how sweetly I had heard the blackcaps
sing in March mornings from the Hotel Bellevue
windows. I looked at the little nest built in the
branches of a budding bramble; it was not unlike that
of a robin, save that it had no moss interwoven in its
structure, and that it was entirely lined with horse hair
and the hair off the backs of the red and white cows of
the country. Inside I saw three eggs of a palish, reddish
brown, sprinkled over with spots of purple. I could
not help noticing how different the three eggs were.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve never before found eggs like this so early,”
said Thady. “Generally the Jack smuts take a deal
of time to settle, but this pair have a-nested and laid as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
soon as they got to the parish.” I bent over the nest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BOWER OF THE MOCK NIGHTINGALE</div>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t touch ’em,” cried Thady, excitedly, “since it’s
yer leddyship’s pleasure to leave them; for the mock
warbler, as dad calls him, he says are as shy as a hawk,
and a touch of the nest will make ’em quit in a twinkling.
Some morning, yer leddyship,” Thady continued,
“yer must come down and hear him. If yer was to get
outside the fence, yer’d catch him some day singing. For
he’s got a strange voice, soft and pretty at one moment
as if he was charming, and the next as if telling the
tales of a thousand victories.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady and I walked home in the twilight. I love
seeing the nests of God’s little wild birds. How wonderfully
they are built. What marvellous architects birds
are, how clever and dexterous, with claw and beak.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the still light of the dying day, the old spire
of the parish church loomed like a gigantic lance
across the rich meadows, and through the stillness I
heard the sound of the chimes. They filled this old
English spot with a sense of rest. No hurry, they
seemed to call, no hurry. Leisure, the best gift of the
gods, is yours and ours. Time to wander, time to see,
time to sleep. I stood and gazed on the quiet scene.
All the pleasant things of spring and summer were
before us. White mists were gathering from the beck
and running in long lines of diaphanous obscurity
across the fields. There was no sound but the distant
chimes. All was sinking gently to rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>I entered the eastern gate and called to Mrs.
Langdale, the old housekeeper, and begged her to give
me a hunch of cake to bestow on Thady. The good
dame handed it through the mullioned window sourly
enough, for Thady was no favourite with such a barndoor-natured
woman as my old housekeeper. “’Tis
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
little I’d get if yer leddyship wasn’t here,” laughed
Thady. “‘Get out and don’t poison the place with yer
breath, yer limb of Satan,’—that’s what I’d hear if yer
wasn’t by, to stand by me,” Thady whispered, as Mrs.
Langdale shut the window with an angry snap.</p>

<p class='c014'>I passed the hunch of cake to Thady, and quickly,
silently he put it into his voluminous pocket, in which it
disappeared as in a well. Then Thady lifted his cap,
and a second later I heard him whistling softly in the
gloaming.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I went into the chapel hall I was greeted by Constance.
I congratulated her warmly on her successful
morning. Nothing could have been better, I said. It
was a real scene of gaiety, and gave, I am sure, all the
young and old, a great deal of enjoyment.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There not a budding boy or girl this day</div>
      <div class='line'>But is got up and gone to bring in May,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I quoted laughingly. “The old times will come back to
Wenlock, thanks to you, Constance,” I said. “Over
each house will be hung bough and garlands, till each
household is given up to laughter and frolic.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is much wisdom in wholesome laughter,”
my friend replied. “Perhaps the best thing that can be
done for the people is to teach them how to play. They
have almost forgotten how, in their desire to make
money.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then my friend and I parted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE RUINED CHURCH</div>

<p class='c014'>After dinner I wandered into the garden. It was a
lovely night. The moon was hardly seen, only in faint
peeps at intervals, but there was a mist of stars. I
faintly saw the vane of the flying crane pointing due
south, and in the distance I heard the hoot of an owl
far away in the Abbot’s Walk. In the pathway I saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
dim shadowy creatures, which turned out to be toads
enjoying the cool moisture of the night. Far away, in
a cornfield, I caught the harsh cry of the corncrake,
calling, calling—as he would call, I knew, all through
the May nights. A little later, and over Windmoor
Hill on the sheep-nipped turf would glisten nature’s jewel,
the glow-worm, but early in May such gems are rarely
to be met with in our cold country. How lovely it was
to wander round the garden and ruined church—to
inhale the scent of the budding lilac, and the poet’s
narcissus in the grass, for where pious knees once knelt
was then a milky way of floral stars. They glittered in
the grass like faint jewels, and their rich perfume gave
the evening air an intoxicating sweetness.</p>

<p class='c014'>My great hound walked at my heels. At night she
is always watchful, and is haunted by a persistent sense
of danger. But even she, that still night, could find
nothing to be alarmed about, or to hurl defiance at.
All the world seemed bathed in a mystic sapphire bath
of splendour, and round me I knew that mystic process
of what we call life was silently but rapidly taking form.
I could almost feel the budding of the trees, for the
wonderful revelation of summer was at hand. To-night,
on an ancient larch, one of the first I have heard that
was planted in Shropshire, a storm-cock, as the country
people call the missel-thrush, piped into the growing
night. What a joyous song his was. He had sung on
and off, since January, and his voice was almost the
loudest and clearest of all the feathered songsters. No
cold could daunt him, but soon he would be silent, for
the storm-cock sings little after May.</p>

<p class='c014'>The world, where not spoilt by smoke and man, was
very fair and full of wonderful things. All was flowering
and growing apace. As I stood in the ruined church,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
love and joy seemed to be borne upon the soft winds as
they fanned my face and played amongst the tender
leaves. I sat down by the ancient lavabo and looked at
the ruined church. How much the walls might tell me
if they could but speak. What stories of stately processions,
for kings and queens were often the guests of
the Prior of Wenlock. Henry I., Henry III., and his
queen Eleanor came, if tradition says true, Charles
Stuart, when fate fought against him, and Impetuous
Rupert, at least to Wenlock. Then the story runs that
Arthur and his Spanish bride passed through Wenlock
on their way to Ludlow. And as I sat there and mused,
I thought of all the great ones who had passed through
and spent days, happy or otherwise, at Wenlock—the
world’s delight and wonder, they were all gone, and the
Abbey too, which was once the pride of Catholicism in
Shropshire, the meeting-place of devout pilgrims, the
resort of royalty, that too had gone. Its walls have
served to build cottages. Its splendour is a thing of the
past, and the owl and the wild birds fly where once
abbot and friar paced in solemn devotion.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>THE LAVABO.</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the church
was used as a quarry, the old folks have often said.
“No need to dig out stone,” one old wheezy man told me;
“when cottages was run up, us used to know where to
go, for pigsties, or even a patch on the road. Have
in a cart, and down went a bit of the Abbey. It was
mighty handy, a deal better than blasting the rock as
they do now to rear a wall.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“King Collins,” as the old people used to call Sir
Watkin’s agent, who lived in the red-brick house which is
now the Vicarage, carted away whatever he had a mind
to. “What he set his heart on that he took,” another
old man said, “and put it afore his own door.”</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HANDFUL OF EARTH</div>

<p class='c014'>I thought of all the changes that Wenlock had seen,
beginning with the foundation of the Saxon nunnery.
Then later of Roger de Montgomery’s Clugniac monks—the
fame of the great Abbey, the Dissolution, poor John
Cressage, its last Prior, the Civil Wars, and the breaking
up of the Abbey fabric through the nineteenth century.
Life often seems to go so slowly, and yet how many
changes Wenlock—and for that matter, every yard of
English soil—has seen, since the dawn of English history,
up to this twentieth century.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here we were in the year 1904, I mused, and this little
plot of ground on which I sat had seen a Saxon saint go
by. It had been traversed by Roger de Montgomery,
Cromwell’s soldiers had fired across it with cannon, and
all the while, sun and rain had had their turns, and soft
spring showers had rejoiced daisy and lady’s-slipper.
Deep winter snows had enshrined tomb and arch, and
all the natural changes of season and climate had
occurred, and will recur to the end of time. Ah, there
are many thoughts to ponder over merely in a handful
of British earth!</p>

<p class='c014'>As I sat on, lost in thought, my great hound’s head
resting at my feet, the silence was broken by the sound
of the old church clock. It struck eleven. I touched
the grass at my feet: it was wet with dew.</p>

<p class='c014'>From behind me as I rose came strongly in a soft
breeze all the perfumes of the sweet things then in flower,
and as I passed out of the cloisters my last vision was
the mead of narcissi nodding softly in the night wind.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mouse and I turned back out of the lily gate,
and so into the quadrangle. Light flashed from the
hanging lamps in the ambulatory, and I heard in the
distance the refrain of an old Brittany song, that
Auguste was singing in his kitchen. Half an hour
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
later not a sound, and the lights were put out, and all
was still. Only the scents of the honeysuckle and the
budding lilac reached me from my open casement, and
the cry of the corncrake, which seemed mysteriously to
record the passing of the hours and the passing of all
things—Kings, Queens, Abbots, Kingdoms and Commonwealths.
So musing I fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>Several weeks later I rose “betimes,” as they say
here, and whilst the dew was lying like a mantle of
diamonds on the glistening turf. I stepped off to the old
red-walled garden and visited the beds of tulips.</p>

<p class='c014'>My late tulips were all out in a blaze of beauty—rose,
red, white, yellow, and gold, whilst some were splashed
with sombre purple. On the walls, the creepers were
all clad in green, and the honeysuckles cast their perfume
in all the corners of the garden. But I did not stop to
linger; a wild spirit was on me, and I made my way
across the golden meadows, past the fern-clad hill, and
beyond what folks call here the paddock. I walked on,
faithful Mouse following closely, until I reached the
bottom of the hill on which the hamlet of Wyke is built,
and then I turned to the north, and retraced my steps
by Farley Dingle.</p>

<p class='c014'>What an enchantingly beautiful thing the dew on
the opening flowers of the dog-rose is, and how delicate
are the red shades of the opening fronds of the bracken.
Then I saw other treasures, none of which were more
lovely than some pink cheeked oak-apples, encircled in
the golden tassels of the oak blossom.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why does one not get up every morning? I said to
myself. Why miss daily the enchantments of morning?
The dew, the scents, and the sunshine were all
delicious.</p>

<p class='c014'>I returned through the little town. Life was just
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
beginning. Shops were opening. A few people drove past
in noisy carts. Mothers were preparing their children
to go to school. Men were going to work after their
breakfasts, to the near fields, or in the shops; whilst
whelp, and hound, and pup, were all gaily frolicking in
the streets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROYAL OAK</div>

<p class='c014'>I saw little friends go by. They laughed and bowed
to me. Nearly all the little lads had got, I noticed, a
sprig of oak leaves in their cap, for it was the 29th of
May, Royal Oak Apple Day, as the folks call it; and
some of them as they passed called out—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Royal Oak</div>
      <div class='line'>I Whig provoke,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and pointed to the badge in their caps.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shropshire is the land of loyalty, and people still
cherish there the memory of the hiding of the King at
Boscobel.</p>

<p class='c014'>The 29th of May is the anniversary of Charles II.’s
Restoration, and the custom since then of wearing oak
leaves on that day still lingers on in many counties.</p>

<p class='c014'>I read once a terrible story of two soldiers in George
I.’s time who were nearly flogged to death in 1716 for
putting oak sprigs in their hats.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Royal Oak, wrote Stukeley, “stood a bow shot
from the house (of Boscobel). Into this tree, Colonel
Carlos and the King climbed by the aid of a hen-roost
ladder. Members of the family fed them by fastening
the victuals to a nut hook. The tree is now enclosed
with a brick wall in the inside of which are placed
laurels. Close to the oak is a thriving plant reared
from one of its acorns.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The story runs that the King, in gratitude, collected
some acorns at a later date from the oak which had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
afforded him a shelter, had them planted in St. James’s
Park, and watered them with his own hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>Are they still growing? I have often asked myself;
or have they perished like the Stuart line and cause?
Be this as it may, the custom of wearing the oak is still
dear to Shropshire lads, and at Wenlock any lad “who
will not mount the green” is considered fair game for
other little lads to pummel and cuff.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I walked down Sheinton Street I noticed that
three little boys came out of a house together. Suddenly
a little lad passed them without the orthodox “tuft of
green.” With a wild whoop the little lads gave chase.
“Bash and bummel him,” they called. “Have at ’un.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I hardly think they knew what they were making this
onslaught on a comrade for, but they would have vaguely
told you, if they could, that it was not what Etonians
would call “good form” to appear at Wenlock on the
29th of May without a “badge of green.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stood and watched the chase. My little Roundhead
was not caught. He dodged his pursuers adroitly, and
in the midst of the hunt the school-bell sounded, so for a
moment an armistice was declared.</p>

<p class='c014'>Before I went in I visited my beds of anemone and
ranunculi. What is there of such enchanting brilliancy
as the exquisite scarlet anemone, the well-known wind
flower of the Pyrenees, as I have heard it called, with
its dazzling scarlet blossoms? But my few clumps were
over. This lovely variety I have never known “a free
grower,” as gardeners call it, in the North, but in Sussex
and Hampshire it is said to do well. The roots that I
had out then were the exquisite double sorts, and some
of the large flowering single varieties. Amongst my
most beautiful named sorts I saw by the labels were—Rose
de Nice, a delicate satiny rose, Snowball, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
Rose Mignon, which last is of a splendid deep shade of
pink. There were also Chapeau de Cardinal, Fire King,
and la Dame Blanche. How lovely they all were, and
how vividly they brought back to me the florists’ shops
at Nice, Cannes, and Mentone. How well I remembered
the big bunches in all colours in their picturesque green
jars of native pottery. But more beautiful still was the
recollection of the sheets of anemones as I saw them in
Sir Thomas Hanbury’s beautiful garden of La Mortola.
They were principally single, and raised from seed by
his gardener, I was told. What a glory of colour they
made with the cypress trees, ilexes and orange groves
as a background, mingling with daffodils and cyclamen,
whilst the air was laden with the scent of orange and
lemon-blossom.</p>

<p class='c014'>I recalled the glory of these lovely visions. Even
here in England a few patches seemed to add greatly to
the beauty and joy of a garden. Then I stopped and
picked a few sprays to copy in my curtain. Whilst thus
engaged, I was conscious that some one was approaching
me. I looked up, and saw my little girl’s governess,
Miss Weldon. By her troubled face I knew that she
had unpleasant news to communicate; in fact, I was
sure the unpleasant rock of Worry was ahead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BESS NAUGHTY</div>

<p class='c014'>I listened, and Bess’s delinquencies were poured forth
into my unwilling ears. My little maid, it appeared, had
bitten the nursery maid, slapped her nurse, and had
ended in a fit of rage by throwing her lesson-books in
her governess’ face. She had flatly refused to do any
lessons to-day. In fact, I was told, she had declined “to
study” ever since the excitement of the recitals for the
May dance; and Miss Weldon declared that she did not
approve of public performances, and pursed up her
lips severely.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
I did not wait to hear any more for, to quote
Burbidge, “the less of a disagreeable you mind, the
better for your supper,” but I went straight into the
house. I went up the old newel stairs and found Bess
on the floor of the nursery. The whole room resounded
with her angry cries. “Horrid slug, stupid snail,” and
other words of opprobrium I heard in quick reiteration.
She kicked, screamed, and vowed she hated everybody
and everything, with a furious, scarlet face. Even old
Nana did not escape her abuse. There was nothing to
be done but to put Bess to bed, and tell her that there
she must remain till I could forgive her, and let her get
up again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hate you, mother!” she cried in a shower of tears.
“When I’m rich I’ll buy a new mother.” And as I
closed the door an angry little voice called out, “I’d
sell you all for sixpence; you’re all horrid, horrid!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I tried to seek peace with my crewels and my needle,
and bethought myself of the bunch of anemones which
in haste I had thrown upon a table in the chapel hall.
But peace that day might not be mine. War, black
war, seemed to have set in in all parts of my demesne.
Célestine bounced in like a whirlwind of discord and
fury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VOICES OF DISCORD</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cette odieuse femme! Cet animal empesté!</span>” by
which civil terms she alluded to the old housekeeper,
who had done something unpardonable; “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais j’aurai
ma place quand même.</span>” Then followed a string of
incoherent abuse. A second afterwards, Mrs. Langdale
appeared, took up the tale, and vindicated her honour
and position. The two women glared at each other
like wild cats, and set to work to abuse each other
roundly, each in her own mother tongue. Célestine
spoke in high southern French, breathless, scarlet, her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
eyes burning like live coals, whilst Mrs. Langdale
screamed shrilly in angry Shropshire tones. Our old
housekeeper does not generally speak in her native
dialect, but in moments of excitement she takes to it as
to her native element. Her voice ran up like the
women’s of the west, and she trembled with fury as she
called forth judgments on foreigners, “furies, and such
like good-for-nothing losellers and vagrants.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So great was their indignation and so near did they
approach each other in passion, that I feared they must
come to blows; but at last they vanished, vowing vengeance,
and filling the monks’ passage with cries of
discord. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa belli</span></i> was difficult to discover, but
there seemed to have been a disagreement over a towel,
a bit of soap, and some key of a cupboard. Anyway,
what was wanting in wit, was fully made up by wrath.</p>

<p class='c014'>How eloquent, at least how voluble, two furious
women of the lower classes can be, like Shakespeare’s
women, in their flights of rage. With us the power of
vituperation is a power of the past. We control ourselves
and our anger smoulders in our hearts, but rarely flies
forth in a whirlwind of words.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last I was left with Mouse, and alone we sat on,
hoping only for peace. How good life would be without
its worries and its quarrels. Mouse and I looked at
each other. “My dog,” I said, “you have one great
merit: you cannot speak.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Yes, the golden pomp had come. The earth was radiant.
Down below the Abbey extended sheets of golden
buttercups, the world was full of song, and a clear turquoise
sky, cloudless and glorious, rose above us, and
all through the joyous days we were bathed in glad
sunshine.</p>

<p class='c014'>Peace had come, inside and outside the house. The
storms that ended May had vanished, and my domestic
coach seemed rolling gaily along. Bess had grown good
again, the roughest children sometimes do. The lessons
were learnt without too much grumbling, and Miss
Weldon no longer carried her head low with shame.
Mrs. Langdale and Célestine had settled down into
hostile neutrality, and for that I was thankful.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ma’zelle’s tongue is like a firebrand, but I give her
no chance, I never speak to her,” my old friend told
me. And as angry silence is better than open war, I
received its advent with thanksgiving; but all messages
were impossible, and I suspected Fremantle had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
hard work to steer his boat between the sullen seas of
“the room.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SUMMER GARDEN</div>

<p class='c014'>But a truce to domestic worries, for early in June I
gardened; that is to say, I stood about on the close-shorn
turf and Burbidge gave directions for the summer
plants to be put in the beds. This always is a solemn
summer function, and Burbidge had all the importance
of a Prime Minister moving amongst his Cabinet, whilst
I stood by and admired.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the east side of the Abbey Farmery, as it was
once called, we had already put in round beds of
heliotrope (the old cherry-pie of childhood). Burbidge
had planted a bed of scarlet verbenas, and was, when I
went out, putting in one of the delicate pure white
variety, that smells so sweet after a passing shower in
the twilight. Besides these, there were to be spudded
in beds of crimson and scarlet geraniums, near the high
southern wall running from the oratory to the gazebo.
We had planted, a few years before, sweet tea-roses of
all colours—pink, orange, and copper, a <i>Choisya ternata</i>,
the orange-blossom of Mexico, patches of close-clinging
Virginian creeper, to enjoy their autumn glory, and
over the pillars different varieties of large-flowering
clematises. These, as they make their full growth, will
be tied to the stone balls that crown the wall. The
clematises are of the most beautiful modern sorts,
mauve, lavender, and purple, and in August and September,
I trust, will repay us amply for our care during
the dark winter months, and in the sharp winds of
March.</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge was solemnly having his plants brought
out, and stood watching that no mishap took place,
for, he assured me, “boys were born careless.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Round the sundial were to be planted four scarlet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
plots of geraniums, and all were to be edged with a
ribbon of blue lobelia. “How commonplace!” some of
my readers will exclaim; but all the same, very gay and
cheery during the late summer and early autumn, and a
brilliant note of colour when the glory of the herbaceous
borders is over. We must always remember that there
are many forms of beauty, and that even the newest one
day will be old-fashioned, and that a fashion immediately
past may have something to commend it, in spite of the
gardening papers of the day, and <em>learned critics</em>. When
the beds were planted and the tiny little string of lobelia
added, then the wire netting that encircled each bed
was carefully put back, or otherwise, to quote Burbidge,
“Adam and his crew would soon be the death of the
greenhouse stuff, sure enough.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After that, we planted a bed of heliotrope, of a
beautiful Jamaica variety, that was brought back from
there by a friend; and then a bed or two of fuchsias,
including a few two- or three-year-old standards in the
centre, for nothing gives a bed greater beauty than that
it should be of different heights. The old flat bed was
poor and ugly, and did not give half the effect of colour
that one does of different heights. Then I saw put out
beds of latana, red, yellow, and brown, and salmon and
pink geraniums, and the old stone troughs and tubs
were filled with rich velvety petunias. After all the
small beds were planted, we came to the long border
immediately in front of the new southern wall. There
Burbidge put in squares of that dear old plant known to
children as the lemon verbena plant, and great patches
of many different sorts of sweet-scented geraniums.
Amongst these delights were the old peppermint, the
rose geranium, the lemon-scented, the citron-scented,
the apple-scented, and the pennyroyal, and some of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
best of the named sorts, such as Little Gem, Pretty
Polly, Lady Plymouth, Shottesham Park, and Lady
Scarborough. Altogether, Burbidge told me with pride,
there were not less than twenty sorts. All these
perfumed pelargoniums have a delicious fragrance
of their own, distinct, and exquisitely sweet. All will
bed out well in an English garden, but care should be
taken to plant out in the same bed sorts that grow
about the same height, as some varieties are much
more vigorous than others in the open, and, to quote
Burbidge’s words, “fair trample down the weaker sorts,
like horses wud childer, if yer put ’em alongside.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In this long border there were also placed round
bushes of Paris Marguerites, and here and there Burbidge
slipped in a castor-oil plant with its overshadowing
handsome foliage and horse-chestnut-like fruit, and at
intervals a spike of cannas, and a plant or two of
tasselled maize with variegated leaf, “to bring them
tropics home,” I was told. Then in the foreground, “his
boys” spudded in African marigolds, soft mauve violas,
asters, and stocks, besides patches of geraniums, to
bring in “a smart snap of colour,” as my old gardener
put it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“SOME NOSEGAY BLOWS”</div>

<p class='c014'>After luncheon I went out on the other side of the
old house, to what is known as the Quadrangle, to
witness further garden operations. I pleaded in favour
of putting into some of the tubs what Burbidge calls
“some nosegay blows.” Burbidge acceded to my request;
“But us must mind the colours too,” he declared. He
put in, however, to please me, a few little brown evening
stocks, that smell sweetest at nights, for I told him that
it was delightful to come and sit out after dinner, and
enjoy the scents of night. He put in a few verbenas
also, for the chance of evening showers, some nicotianas,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
and a few crimson humeas. Round the old redstone
building, he planted three rows of Jacoby geraniums,
“For them will mean brightness,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I stood and watched the last row of geraniums
being put in the soil, I was joined by Bess and
Mouse.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, mum!” Bess told me, “Mouse has been growling
and growling at something behind the ivy. If it had
been at night, I should say she had met a devil or ogre.
Every minute she was with Nana and me, she got
crosser and crosser; and see, her nose is quite red and
bleeding, just like Hals’ when he tumbled downstairs.
Could it be a real robber?” and Bess’s eyes opened
wide.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” I answered, “I don’t think it could be a robber;
but let’s go and see.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So we started off across the gravel. Mouse ran
on ahead, as if anxious to show us something.
Suddenly she stopped with a whimper. I followed
on, jumped down the crypt, and, peering behind
the ivy leaves, soon discovered the cause of my dog’s
excitement and displeasure. I found half covered
up with dead leaves and rolled tightly into a ball of
prickles, a poor little hedgehog.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For shame, Mouse!” I cried, and called her off.
For Mouse, at the sight of the poor little beast, growled
angrily, and wished once more to go for her antagonist.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Better to kill un’,” said Burbidge, who had arrived
on the scene. “Hedgehogs baint good for naught.
They be milk-suckers, and death on the squire’s game.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For like most country-folks, Burbidge’s hand was
against hedgehogs. Burbidge had in his hand a rake,
and was about to strike the poor little prickly creature,
but I interposed.</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MY SANCTUARY</div>

<p class='c014'>“They do no harm. Besides, this is my sanctuary,”
I said. “In the Abbey Church no bird or beast may be
harmed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge walked away growling, “Varmint should
be killed anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Bess and I went and inspected the little ball of
spikes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“See, Bess,” I said, “how it defends itself. All the
winter this hedgehog has slept amongst a bed of dead
ivy leaves, and so has passed long months. But now
that summer has returned it will walk about, and at
nights he will crop the grass, and eat insects.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mouse looked abashed at my lavishing notice on a
hedgehog, and jumped up on a bank of thyme and
watched intently what I was doing. Great Danes are
remarkably sensitive dogs, and the mildest rebuke is
often sufficient to make them miserable for long spells.
A friend of mine, who had a very large one, said, “I never
dared do more than whip its kennel. As a puppy, that
was punishment enough.” So I spoke gently to Mouse,
and said, “You must never hurt hedgehogs again.” At
this, Mouse gravely descended from her heights, sat
down by my side, and inspected the hedgehog, and I felt
certain she would never hurt one again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I said to Bess that perhaps there were some
little hedgehogs not far off, funny little creatures, born
with little, almost soft, prickles; and I told the child how
useful they were in a garden. How they feed on slugs
and insects, and how, when introduced in a kitchen, they
would even eat black beetles.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Once,” I told my little maid, “I had read that a
poor scullion, in the Middle Ages, had one that he taught
to turn the spit. So you see, Bess,” I said, “hedgehogs
can be very useful creatures; not at all the wicked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
murderous race that Burbidge would wish you to
believe.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess looked at me askance. “I cannot like them
as much as you, mama,” she answered in a pained
voice; “for Nana said too that they sucked the cows.
And see how this one has pricked poor Mouse’s
nose.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, let us leave the hedgehog,” at last I said,
“and wash foolish Mouse’s wounds.” So we wandered
off to the fountain, and dipped our handkerchiefs into
the clear water, and washed my great hound’s fond and
foolish nose.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first, Mouse objected; but as Bess told her, “One
gets used to washing, same as lessons,” so after a minute
or two, she sat by us until we had washed away all
traces of the fray.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we were thus engaged, Auguste, the French cook,
went by. I noticed, as he passed us, that he carried
in his hand a basket.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Voyez, madame,” he cried. “Quelle belle trouvaille.
Elles sont superbes.” And he showed me a
mass of creepy, crawly, slimy brown snails. Auguste
was as proud as if he had found a basketful of new-laid
eggs, and proposed with his aides to have a
magnificent <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souper</span></i>. “Quelle luxe!” I heard him say
to himself, as he made his way to his kitchen, “et
dire dans toute cette valetaille il n’y a que nous, qui en
voudrons.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Auguste will steep them in cold water, and then
cook them. I must honestly confess I have never had
the courage to eat one, but I believe now that there is a
growing demand for escargots in London, and I have
been told that in one shop alone, more than a hundred
thousand are sold each season.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
“Come on, mamsie,” at last cried Bess. “Even
Nana couldn’t make Mouse cleaner.” So my little maid
and I went off hand-in-hand across the well-tended
lawns of the Cloister garth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“ONLY YOU AND ME AND MOUSE”</div>

<p class='c014'>Bess was full of confidences. “Mamsie,” said my
little maid, “I never want to grow any older, ’cause
why—I should have to wear long, long dresses, like
grown-ups, and then, how could I climb the trees. But
I should like all days to go on just the same as to-day—no
lessons, no rain, no governesses, nobody but you and
me and Mouse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I caught something of the child’s enthusiasm. The
glory of the summer was like an intoxicating draught.
“Wouldn’t it be lovely, dear,” I said, “to have no
commonplaces, no tiresome duties—only summer and
the song of birds; and never to catch cold, or feel ill, or
tired, or worried?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess laughed, and we kissed each other.</p>

<p class='c014'>We walked on along the path that encircled the
ruins. Young, fat, flopperty thrushes, with large brown
eyes and short tails, hopped about the grass. On the
bough of a lime tree, we came across a line of little
tom-tits, nine in a row. There they sat, chirping softly,
or charming, as the people call it here. The poor
parent birds, in an agony of terror, flew backwards and
forwards, imploring their offspring to return to the nest,
but the young ones took no notice. They would not
believe in the existence of such monsters as boys or cats.
They, too, like us, were charmed with the sunshine
and the gaiety of the outside world, and utterly declined
to go back to what folks call here, “their hat of
feathers.” A little further on, however, our enthusiasms
received a chill. In the branches of a dead
laurel, that I had for some time been watching, was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
thrush’s nest, and it was deserted. The mother-bird
had sat day and night, and I had watched the tips of
her brown tail, or met, at intervals, the gaze of her
round anxious eye. And now the nest was forsaken.
How sad! She had become almost a friend. For days,
after breakfast, I had brought out a saucer full of bread
and milk, and placed it at a respectful distance from
the nest. And yet in spite of all my care, behold!
an enemy had come in the night, some horrid boy or
evil cat, and the thrush had forsaken the nest, and we
lamented over the eggs—cold as stones.</p>

<p class='c014'>I showed Bess the nest. “How wicked!” cried
Bess, “to frighten off a poor bird like that. Well, I am
sure,” she added, “the wicked creature that has done
that ought to go to prison. Perhaps Barbara, the
housemaid,” she continued, after a moment’s reflection,
“might tell her policeman. Policemen should be of
use, sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With a sense of regret, I retraced my steps, till I
reached the tourist’s wicket, that leads into the public
road. Seated close by, on a mossy bank, I found old
Timothy Theobalds.</p>

<p class='c014'>I told him about the forsaken thrush’s nest.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lord, love yer, marm!” he answered contemptuously,
“they be as common as blackberries, be thrushes; there’s
any amount of they—there be one not a hundred yards
off, just on the ground. The feathered gentry will fly,
give ’em a week or so. I don’t think nothin’ of they.
But I do remember a yellow water wagtail’s nest, when I
was a boy. It war down by the pond. I was stayin’ with
grandam, and the missus that lived here at the farm
had a fine lot of white ducks then. Well, she seed me
one day speerin’ round, and her thought I war arter her
ducks. ‘What be yer lookin’ round here for?’ her cried
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
out, furious. I told her I was arter a yellow dip-tail,
but her wouldn’t believe me. ‘I’ll mak’ yer know the
taste of the willow’—for there was a great one then by
the pond—‘and yer won’t wish to know it twice,’ her
said. Farmer folk war masterful then” mused old
Timothy; “they held the land from the gentry, and
the land was meat and drink.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After a pause I asked the old man if he was not
enjoying the sunshine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE APPLE HOWLERS</div>

<p class='c014'>“Pretty fair,” he replied. “But how about the
apples? ’Tis good,” he acknowledged, “a bit of
summer; but yer should have know’d the summers
in the old days,” he exclaimed; “they war built
up by plenty. Now,” he said, sadly, “there’s always
somethin’ agin’ summer, like there be agin’ most
things. Summer blows bain’t enough to content poor
folks like me. Us old ’uns want our apples bobbin’ in
beer come Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I then remembered hearing a few days before that
the apple-blossom had been sadly nipped by the late
spring frosts.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Them as is rich can buy the foreigners,” pursued
Master Theobalds, “but to poor folks, frosts mean the
end of pleasure. But there bain’t like to be much fruit now
in the orchards,” he continued, “since folks have given
up the decent customs of their forefathers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What ones?” I asked. “And how did folks in the
years gone by prevent frosts, and blights?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’ll hear, you’ll hear,” and old Timothy, in a
high squeaky voice of ninety years and more, told me of
old Wenlock customs long since forgotten.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I mind me,” he pursued, “when it war different;
but in grandam’s time, it was a regular custom for
them as had apple trees and plum orchards to get the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
young men to go round and catch round the trees with
their arms——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What good did that do?” I asked, somewhat
surprised.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What good!” and old Timothy glared at me for
this impertinent interpellation. “Why, mam, it was
accounted a deed of piety in those days ‘to march’ the
orchards, as folks called it. Religion war a different
thing altogether, even when I war a lad,” he said sadly.
“The devil we thought a lot of ’im in my time—always
raging and rampaging up and down, it was supposed.
Now, from what I hear, he seems a poor lame kind of
played-out devil, broken-winded and drugged; not the
rowdy, handsome chap us used to be afeard of. Years
agone we thought he could get anywhere—in our houses,
in our cupboards, up the chimney, down the wells, anywhere.
‘Keep him out,’ parsons used to say; and us
thought us had done a good job if us could keep him
out of our gardens, and from our fruit trees. So the
lustiest lads of a parish would come round, call out a
benediction, and tramp round. They would—they that
war nimble with their fists—have a set-to, mostly, at
Wenlock, in the churchyard. Many’s the match I’ve a-seen.
Two young fellows fighting, fair and square, as
Christians should, and after they had found the best man,
they’d go and brace the trees. ‘Apple Howlers’ folks used
to call ’em, and the best man war captain of the lot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What did they do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, they used to march in smocks, and with garlands
and blows, same as on May Day. Holy Thursday
war the great day, I’ve heard tell, and ’em used to shout
till ’em fair broke their lungs, singing such old songs
as ‘Blow winter snows across the plain,’ ‘Fair shines
my lady’s garden,’ ‘Spring voices strong,’ and ‘Phœbus
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_243' id='Page_243'>243</a></span>
smiles on groves anew.’ Who Phœbus was I never
knowd,” remarked old Timothy, “but Salter Mapps
used to sing that finely and mak’ the whole place alive
when he roared it out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And the maids,” I said, “did they have no part in
the merry-making?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE MAIDS HELD THEIR PEACE”</div>

<p class='c014'>“The maids,” answered Master Theobalds, severely,
“held their peace. If they did anything, they peeped
out of the winders, waved hankies, and kissed their
hands. ’Twas enough for the maids in those days.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes; but tell me,” I urged, “about the rite. What
did the young men do in the orchards?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, them rampaged round like young cart colts
on spring grass, and they seized each others’ hands and
danced aunty-praunty, as if their arms were made of
cart-ropes, round the trees, and they capered like young
deer, as the deer do at Apley Park, up beyond Bridgenorth,
and they kind of hugged a tree, crying out—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Stand fast root, bear well top,</div>
      <div class='line'>God send us a youngling sop.</div>
      <div class='line'>Every twig big apple,</div>
      <div class='line'>Every bough fruit enough.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And then wherever they passed they got cakes and ale.
There war holy beer, made from church water caught
in a butt from the roof, and that war supposed to be
the best—‘the life of the season,’ folks called it then.
And if the lads got a touch too merry, folk knew what
to do—they looked the other way. Rough play, rough
pleasure; but they war men then.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the old man ceased talking, I remembered having
read in some old book on “Strange Customs” an
account of “Apple Blow Youling,” as it was called in
the West. The rite was probably a survival of an old
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
heathen custom. It is supposed that it arose from a
Roman practice of giving thanks to Æolus, the god of the
winds, and that this pious invocation was instituted by
them soon after their conquest of Britain. Anyway, the
rite became popular, and long survived the occupation
of the Romans; and in some places, apple youling, or
howling, went on through the early part of the nineteenth
century. There was a pause, and then old Timothy
began to talk about the difficulty of inducing village
maids to go into domestic service.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They all thinks themselves born ladies now,” he
said sourly. “There’s my cousin Polly Makin’s granddaughter,
a fine strapping lass to look at, but her went
off last week to Birmingham. Dull, ’er said, it be here.
What does her mean,” asked the old man, in a tone of
righteous wrath, “by finding it dull in her native town?
When folks found it dull in their native place, when I
war a lad, we called ’em stoopid; now they calls ’em
larned and too good. Now ’tis all roar and express
train. But her’ll creep back some day, will Polly—young
Polly, and be glad and thankful to find a place
to lie her head in. They be all for pleasurin’ now,
expeditions and excursions, running everywhere with no
eyes, that’s what I call their modern games.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But in old days, if I had wanted a housemaid or a
scullery-maid, what should I have done?” I asked,
bringing back my old friend to his subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD-WORLD SERVANTS</div>

<p class='c014'>“In old days,” replied Timothy, “there warn’t no
manner of difficulty in the matter. The men and the
maids used to stand in their native places on hire,
which was a decent, open custom. At Christmas, there
war the Gawby Market in the North; at Whitchurch there
war the Rag Fair, as they called it; and at Shrewsbury,
during fair time, all the farmers and their wives used to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span>
go in to engage a maid or a man. At Much Wenlock,
I’ve heard hirin’ day was 12th of May; at Church
Stretton it used to be on the 14th. At Market Drayton,
I’ve often, in the forties and fifties, seen the carters stand
forth, whips in hand, so that all might know their trade,
and cry out, ‘A driver, a driver, good with a team,’ and
such-like. Then the lasses wud stand with broom, or
milk-pails and make known their callings, and the
missuses and the masters would look round and engage
who they had a mind to; and they cud mostly all scrub
and clean, milk and churn, brew and bake in those days,
for they couldn’t read nor write, so their hearts were set
on housewifely jobs. But now the maids know nought.
It is all eddication, all readin’ and writin’, and they
mostly can do nothing with a broom, or a brush. Readin’
isn’t often much good to ’em what works. Now servant
wenches talk of getting engaged; hirin’ war the word in
the old time. When they war got in the old time, it war
for a year, and not a penny did most of ’em get till the
year had slipped away.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wasn’t that rather hard?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The lads and lasses of the old days,” answered
Timothy, not without a certain dignity, “took the rough
with the smooth. Folks then didn’t all spec’ to find
roast larks dissolved in their mouths when they opened
them, any more than to pull roses at Yuletide. Hard
work and plenty of it, small pay and long service, that
war their lot—the lot of the lads I knew by name.
Times war harder than they be now, but Shropshire war
a better, more manly place than it be now. Now there’s
no hirin’. The maids go off to registry offices in back
streets. Palaver, dress, and flummery, that’s what
service be now. They writes up, and off they goes to
London, Wolverhampton, or Birmingham. Not much
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
but paper and stamps now in service. A deal of dislikes
and not an honest peck of work in the whole year—that’s
what folks call progress now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we passed on to other subjects. “Is the world
better, Timothy,” I asked, “for the abolition of the
stocks, and pillory? Surely the punishments of the old
world were very brutal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But my old friend would not allow this.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Rough sinners need rough measures,” he said.
“The stick, when used properly, be a right good medicine,
and when the stick bain’t enough, take the lash.
They cannot rule, as be afraid of tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In old Shropshire the law crushed offence. At
Newport the stocks were up till late years, and I mind
me ’tisn’t more than half a century ago that they were
used at Wenlock. They had made a new one, it seems
the last, and put it on wheels, so that it might run like
a Lord Mayor’s coach, they said. But to the last man,
Snailey, as they put in, ’twas no punishment, for his
friends they handed him up beer the whole way, and
he came out drunk as a lord. I’ve never seen ’em
whipped, but grandam did many’s the time,” continued
old Timothy. “One of the posts of the Guildhall made
the whippin’-post in the old times. And grandam often
told me how she seed ’em herself whipped from the
dungeon below the Guildhall to the White Hart Inn, and
so round the town.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>THE OLD GUILDHALL.</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>“When the job was over,” pursued old Timothy,
“they washed the stripes with salt and water. Old
Sally Shake-the-Pail, as they called her, wud come
round with salt and water, and sponge their backs.
They used, I’ve heard, some of ’em, to scream fit to
leave their skins behind; whilst others, grandam used
to say, would never speak, lay on the lash as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
would, and walk round the town smilin’, so braced up
war they, to appear as if they didn’t mind a farthin’
piece.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAINS AND JUDGMENTS</div>

<p class='c014'>“The Judgments, as they war called,” continued
my informant, “took place on market days. Then it
war as they put a bridle on the scolds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lor!” chuckled old Timothy, “’tis a scurvy pity
as they can’t clap ’em on now. There’s many a
wench as would be the better for it. There be Rachel
Hodgkis, own cousin to Young Polly, and Mary Ann
James, my great-nevy’s wife, as ’twould do pounds of
good to. But things are changed now, and ’tis all the
women folks as have got the upper hand, and any
pelrollick may grin, flount, jeer, and abuse as much
as it plaizes her now. But in the old times it war
different—different altogether.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then old Timothy went on to say, “Many’s the
time as I’ve seen Judy Cookson in a bridle. Her war
a terrible sight in one. Her wud scream and yell till
her mouth fair ran with blood. Judy, folks said, cud
abuse against any—in fact,” old Timothy said, with
local pride, “I think her cud have given points to many
in Shrewsbury. Her war that free with her tongue,
and bountiful of splitters.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Besides these old judgments,” said Timothy, “I’ve
seen many strange things—sale of wives, and such-like
trifles. Did yer ever hear, marm, the story of how Seth
Yates sold his wife?” There was a pause, then Timothy
drew breath and began afresh. “It must have been
seventy years and odd,” he declared, “but I mind it
all as if war yesterday. A bit of a showery day, rain
on and off, but sunshine between whiles.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yates, the husband, he lived at Brocton, and he
and his missus couldn’t git on nohow. They fought,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
they scratched, and scrabbled like two tom-cats that
had met on the roof. Mattie, they said, would screech
and nag, and then Seth wud take up a stick and lay
it on sharp. This went on for weeks, till the neighbours
said there was no peace, and that they cud bear it
no longer. The hurly-burly and rampage war that
disgraceful.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So Mattie thought matters over. She had a
Yorkshire cousin at the hall, came from Barnsley, or
some such outlandish place, her said, and her thought
out, by her advice, how her cud carry out a separation
with her man. ‘Getting shunt,’ Venus, her cousin,
named it; for it appears in Yorkshire yer can sell
yer wife, same as yer dog, if yer’ve got a mind, and
even the bishops there say ’tis a handy practice. So
Mattie said what can be done in Yorkshire can be done
in Shropshire, for ’tis the same king as rules over the
land.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Seth he spoke up for a private sale; but Mattie
said, ‘I war married in public, and I’ll be sold in
public,’ for her war fearful of the law, seeing what
back-handers the law can give, when they mightn’t
reasonably be expected. And so they settled as all
should be done fair and square, and above board on
market day. Then for once folks said the pair they
agreed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was the sale effected?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Simple and straightforward, same as pigs in a
pen,” replied old Timothy. “The missus, her came
into the market, dressed in her Sunday best, in a trim
cotton, and wearin’ a new and stylish tippet, with fine
ends of primrose ribbon, and round her neck her gude
man had put a halter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WIFE FOR SALE</div>

<p class='c014'>“When Yates got to Wenlock market, he turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
shy and silly. ‘Let be, missus,’ he said to his wife,
‘I’ll treat thee fair, if thee’ll keep a civil tongue.’ But
her turned round savage like, like a hen when a terrier
pup will meddle with her clutch of chickens, and her
flapped her apurn slap in his face. ‘I’ve come in to
be sold,’ her said, ‘and I wull be sold if there’s justice
in England according to civilized customs.’ And them
as was standing by roared with laughter, and Tom
Whinnall, a cheap Jack, turned to Seth and he cried
out, ‘Let her be. A man never did wisely yet what
kept a woman ’gainst her will. A woman what won’t
settle, be as mad as a tup in a halter.’ So Seth he
got shamed like, and he called out, ‘Have it thy own
way.’ And her cried out furious, ‘I’d rather go down
the river like Jimmy Glover’s cat, than bide with thee.’
Then she got up in an empty cart, and Tom Whinnall
he put her up for auction. Her fetched half a crown
and a pot of beer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what happened afterwards?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, nothing much,” replied Master Theobalds.
“Anyway, Mattie had nothing to complain of. David
Richards bought her, a great strapping fellow, that
worked for the farmer at the Abbey, afore they turned
it back into a mansion. Folks said that Mattie showed
off first night, but David he just looked at her, and she
minded him from the beginning. The neighbours never
heard a sound. He war masterful war David, and he
looked blacker than night when he had a mind, which,
I take it, is the right way with such as Mattie, for sure
enough the two lived happy as Wreken doves in the
Bull Ring till Mattie died.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Were there any penances in your time, Timothy?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Timothy scratched his head and looked puzzled,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
and at last answered, “I never seed any, but I’ve
heard of ’em. Betty Beaman was the last as I’ve
heard tell of. She had, it seems, to appear before all
the people in a white sheet. Her felt it war cruel hard,
I’ve heard grandam say. One day a neighbour told,
of how years afterwards, her stood by the pump and
told a friend that her had never got over that job.
Her felt the misery of it even then. And her hoped
some good soul would help the Lord to disremember,
if so be she ever got to paradise.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Old Timothy stopped talking. “I must get back to
my cup of tea,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='c014'>I put in his hand a little coin. “This will fill your
pipe,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s nought like backy,” he answered. “’Tis
meat and drink, and makes yer forget.” Then leaning
heavily on his stick, the old man got up.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw him walk past the old watch-tower of the
monks, and stop at his old black and white timber
house in the Bull Ring. As he pattered along, the
brilliant sunshine struck upon his smock, and lighted
up the elaborately embroidered yoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>What a changed world it is, I said to myself. How
completely one seems to hear the voice of the Middle
Ages in listening to old Timothy’s tales. Scolds, bridles,
whipping-posts, penances, and stocks. As I mused, the
sound of all others that belongs essentially to modern
England reached me. Within a few hundred yards
away I heard an engine puffing up and down.</p>

<p class='c014'>Truly, in this country of ours, the old and the new
are very close. I stood up on the base of a broken
column, heard the guard’s whistle, and saw engine and
train go off into the far country. Whilst I was thus
engaged, Bess ran up.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
“Have you done?” she asked. “When you and
old Timothy get together, he tells you a pack of rubbish,
Nan says.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TWILIGHT STROLL</div>

<p class='c014'>That evening, in the twilight, I walked round the
bee garden. Mouse lay outside by the wrought-iron
gates and watched me. How delicious it is, the first
fulfilment of everything in the glory of early June. My
white Martagon lilies were covered with lovely little wax-like
bells. The English crimson peony blossoms were all
out, whilst their Chinese sisters had great knobby buds
which would open shortly, and their bronze-tinted foliage
was a beautiful ornament to the garden. My hybrid
perpetual roses were not yet in flower, for Shropshire
is a cold county compared to Sussex or Surrey; but
the glory was on the wing, and would come to us surely,
if a little later than in the south of England. My single
rose bushes were all rich with buds. How lovely Harrisoni
would be shortly, I thought. And soon my hedge of
Penzance briars would be a perfect barrier of sweetness,
I mused. Then I looked below, and saw that
my beautiful columbines were nearly all in full perfection.
How delicate they were in colouring, in their
soft grey, topaz pinks, and die-away lavenders and
ambers. They recalled shades of opal seen through
flame and sunlight, and fading skies after glorious sunsets.
Last summer I got a packet of Veitch’s hybrids,
and this year I have been amazed at their beauty.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I passed on to my lupines. They were all in
bud, white, blue, and purple, a great joy to the bees. A
little further off were great clumps of Oriental poppies,
neatly and fully staked by Burbidge. Tied so that they
could flower to their heart’s content and in full enjoyment
of air and sunlight; not tied up in faggots, such
as the ordinary gardener delights in.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
I fondly wandered round and round. How good it
was to be out in the opening splendour of June, and to
look at everything to one’s heart’s content.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no sound of voices. Burbidge and his
men had left the garden for the night, only the notes
of blackbird and thrush reached me softly from the
bushes beyond. To-night they, too, seemed almost
dazed, with the glory of summer and were singing
below their breath, as if worn out with the beauty
of nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last I tore myself away from the red-walled
garden, and went and looked at the tubs full of geraniums
and at the beds on the east side. How cool and
happy they looked, and how grateful for the bountiful
moisture they had received from hose and water-can.
Drops glistened faintly on the stems, and the plants
seemed to be drinking in the water with avidity. How
good it was, accomplished work, and how sweet the stillness
of a summer evening.</p>

<p class='c014'>I stole back into the house and looked on the little
table for the letters that had come by the second post.
I found one from Mrs. Stanley. “I think,” she wrote
“after all, that you and Bess have the best of it. For
poor little Hals ever since he has been here has been
poorly and ailing. Oh! why cannot children be well in
London?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I asked Bess the question, for she stood by me, about
to say “good night” before going off to the little white
cot upstairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why should poor children?” she answered, with a
pout. “London is so dull.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I kissed my little maid and said, “Then we must get
Hals down here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this Bess clapped her hands. “Of course we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
must,” she cried. “If people want to be happy, they
should live at Wenlock.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat down that evening and asked Mrs. Stanley to
send her little boy down to us. “The country just now
is so sweet and fresh that it must do him good,” I wrote.
“We will take the greatest care of him; and here he
has all the world to play in.” The next morning I told
Bess what I had done.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” repeated Bess, gravely, “all the world to
play in, and that is what a poor boy can never have in
London. There is no place there, excepting for motors
and policemen.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFTER THE RAIN</div>

<p class='c014'>All through the night sweet summer rain fell. How
delightful a morning is after such rain. How happy
every plant and leaf looked, how greedily all seemed to
have drunk their fill—trees, shrubs, grass, and flowers.
What an aspect of deep refreshment everything had,
as if an elixir of life had been poured into the veins of
every tree and herb.</p>

<p class='c014'>Speckled thrushes hopped about and caught earthworms
as they peered up through the lawns. On the
stone steps leading up to the red-walled garden lay the
broken remains of many dusky shells of the monks’
snails, or as the children call them here, “snail housen.”
Beside these lay also broken fragments of beautiful
yellow, and pale pink ones. A little later I walked
into the garden to look at my great bed of roses.
What a wonderful change one night of rain had
made! How the shoots had lengthened, how “the
blows,” as Burbidge calls them, had expanded. What
a difference in the fat buds! The aphides, which
seemed such a pest a week before, had vanished,
while the leaves were refreshed and glittered with
dew-drops.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
Henricus Stephanus’ old lines came back to me—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The rose, is the care and the love of the spring,</div>
      <div class='line'>The rose is the pleasure of th’ heavenly Pow’rs;</div>
      <div class='line'>The boy of fair Venus, Cyther’s darling,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth wrap his head round with garlands of rose</div>
      <div class='line'>When to the dance of the graces he goes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Amongst my beautiful modern roses, I noted that
La France was opening two delicious buds. What a
beautiful rose it is; and what an exquisite perfume it
possesses! Then I found a gorgeous Fisher Holmes, a
General Jacqueminot, and a Captain Christy. All these
had been born, as Bess calls it, in the night. Besides
these modern joys, I paused to notice my old-world
friends. I could not pass by without casting a glance
upon the loves of Gerard and Parkinson. The pimpernel
rose, little Scotch briars of different sorts, the
little single rose without thorns, the damask, the yellow
cabbage, and the splendid vermilion, the musk, the
single cinnamon and the great Holland, all these have
their places in different parts of my garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>Parkinson tells us how at Longleete in his time people
said that a rose tree then bore white roses on one side,
and red on the other; but the old writer looked upon
this as a fable, and declared, “This may be as true as
the old story that a white hen visited Livia Augusta
with a sprig of bays, and foretold, Augusta believed, by
so doing empire to Augusta’s posterity, and extinction
to the race when the brood of the hen failed.” Be this
as it may, I have a standard rose with a Gloire de Dijon
and a General Jacqueminot budded on the same tree.
Burbidge was much pleased with the combination of
colours and called it Christian and Heathen—names, I
fancy, first bestowed by his old wife Hester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREY MARE AND ROSEMARY</div>

<p class='c014'>Before I left the red-walled garden, I stopped before
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
a bush of rosemary. I pinched a leaf and picked a
little spray on which were some minute blossoms just
coming into flower. Farmers’ wives of Shropshire use
the leaves for flavouring their lard, and a bush or two
is to be found in every farmhouse border.</p>

<p class='c014'>I remembered the great bushes of this plant that I
saw in the Riviera above Mentone, and near the Italian
frontier on the road to Bordighera. I recalled Evelyn’s
affection for this fragrant plant, and I recollected what
he tells us in his delightful diary, after a night at
Loumas in 1644, about this delightful aromatic shrub.</p>

<p class='c014'>After passing the Durance, he wrote, “We came
upon a tract of country covered with rosemary, lavender,
lentiscs and the like sweet shrubs, for many miles
together, which to me was very pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Yes, I said to myself, the scent is very pleasant, health
and sweetness combined, in which is nothing cloying or
sickly. I laughed for the old Shropshire proverb came
back to me of “Where the grey mare is stalled, rosemary
grows apace.” I have heard it said that in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries it was the fashion to
put rosemary on and round the corpses of the old.
“Vors for maids, rosemary and lavender for those as
die old in God,” an old cottager once said to me; and
the same old body told me that in her mother’s time
“’twas thought a mark of respect to put a bunch of
sweet-smelling herbs round a dear dead face, such as
the sage tree, a sprig of thyme, a bunch of lavender, or
a branch of rosemary.” What a pretty offering such
must have been! One can imagine dim figures in the
gloaming going up to the chamber of death some
summer evening—old friends and gossips in smocks, or
with countryside chintz bonnets, and each guest placing
a spray of some sweet herb, as a tribute of affection, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
the dear dead face that would never wake up, or speak
to them again.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few steps from the rosemary bush is my plant of
fraxinella. Its stalk glistened with sweet stickiness.
It was of the white variety, far more beautiful than the
one generally known as the pink.</p>

<p class='c014'>Years ago in an old Hampshire garden I loved as
a child, I was taken out by my father’s old gardener
with my sister to see his “Burning Bush.” I recollected,
as if it had been only yesterday, that as little girls we
had been allowed to sit up once till nine, to see the
bush set on fire. I thought then this harmless bonfire
the most wonderful and mystic thing that I had ever
seen. We went out with our old nurse and saw it lighted
at a distance, our old nurse holding both our hands.
How wonderful it seemed in the stillness of the summer’s
evening, with no sound but the distant singing of the
birds. I remember how the old gardener, who had lived
with father, grandfather and great-uncle, told us the
story of the burning bush and bade us read our Bibles,
and how we believed for years afterwards that we two
had seen a miracle and had stood on holy ground that
summer night.</p>

<p class='c014'>For many years I lost sight of the fraxinella as a
border plant. The good old gardener of my old home
died, and the burning bush was dug up, I heard, under
an evil successor, and thrown on the midgeon heap, and
alone the memory of the mystic plant and the still
summer’s evening remained with me.</p>

<p class='c014'>But after my marriage, I remembered spending a
June in France, and one day in the first week in June
I saw the altar of the cathedral at Laon decked with
great sprays of lovely white fraxinella. The scent was
intense—heavier than the heaviest incense. I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
sensitive to the perfume of flowers, and therefore could
not remain long in the edifice, but the odour brought
back the memory of the burning bush of my childhood,
and I went off to a florist in the market-place and
bought two packets of seeds for my Shropshire home.
One was a packet of the pink variety, and the other was
of the white. When I returned to the Abbey the seeds
were sown by Burbidge, but, to quote the old man,
“they was as shy of coming up as blows be in snow.”
We waited and we waited for any sign of life.</p>

<p class='c014'>All through the late summer and autumn there was
no symptom of vegetation. The seeds, which were like
little black shot, remained dormant. For many months
there was no change.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE FOREIGNERS” CONDEMNED</div>

<p class='c014'>At last Burbidge lost all patience. “Put they,” and
he pointed to the boxes in which the fraxinella seeds
were sown, “put they on the midgeon heap, and let
the foreigners get their deserts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Happily I stood by when this order was given, and
pleaded that they should be left a little longer. One
chilly day in February, when the only sign of the
return of life seemed the gilding of the willows, I peered
into the frame, and I saw, as gardeners say, “my seeds
on the move,” and in due time my old gardener reared
me some half-dozen plants. After some abuse, Burbidge
has taken kindly to the “foreigners,” and now graciously
allows “that yer might do worse than grow fraxinella in
a garden.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I leant over and smelt the long white spikes, and
thought of the old plant in the Hampshire garden.
I noticed that the sticky stem was a perfect fly-trap,
and that hundreds of little insects were caught and
drowned in it like in the leaves of the sun-dew on
Scotch moors. It is this sticky fluid, I am told, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
burns without injuring the plant, when set on fire on
a summer’s night. Every part of the fraxinella is
redolent of fragrance—leaf, stalk, and petals—later, even
the husk of the seed pod. All are exquisitely perfumed;
and the husks, if gathered, will retain their sweetness
for long months together.</p>

<p class='c014'>A little further off, I stood before my clumps of
pinks. I have a great many sorts, and all are deliciously
sweet—the sweetest of all flowers I have heard them
called.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Chaucer’s time it was the fashion, it seems, to
talk of the “parwenke of prowesse;” in Sir Philip
Sidney’s age, writers spoke of “the pink of courtesy.”
We no longer compare a high and noble spirit to a
flower. Do we love flowers less?</p>

<p class='c014'>I walked up and down before my lines of pinks and
wondered. I have the lovely Amoor pink, the pretty
Maiden, the chocolate brown and white, the delicate
little Cheddar, peeping up between stones and rocks,
and a lovely little Norwegian variety that a friend
brought me back from a fishing-lodge. My little
Scandinavian friend has a low habit of growth, in fact,
only rears its pink head a few inches from the soil,
but its blossoms are of a radiant rose, and deliciously
sweet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Later in the day I went down a quiet path in the
kitchen garden, that faces east. There were no bright
colours there, only sober-tinted old-world herbs. Every
monastic garden in the days of the Plantagenets had
its herbularis, or physic garden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HERB GARDEN</div>

<p class='c014'>Here there were little square beds of rosemary,
of rue, fennel, linseed, rye, hemp, thyme, woodruff,
camomile, mallow, clove, and basil. Of the clove basil
Parkinson wrote, that “it was a restorative for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
weak heart, and was known to cast out melancholy and
sadness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge still cuts and dries these herbs, and
village folks and cottagers from the neighbourhood
come for others.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fennel tea,” he tells me, “is good to purify the
blood, mallow is excellent for rheumatism, whilst thyme,
pounded fine, serves in cases of colic.” Boiled lily
bulbs for healing wounds, I am told, are also good.
Then, in the corner against the wall, there is a patch
of the old single violet, which I have heard is very
soothing for inflammation, and now often advocated for
curing cancer. Also a clump of borage, which Gerard
declares, “comforteth the heart, purgeth melancholy,
and quieteth the phrantick.” A few steps away I saw
a patch of crane’s-bill, the old geranium of the Middle
Ages, which the same writer recommended to be prepared
with red snails and to be taken internally.</p>

<p class='c014'>Besides these, nestling against the wall, I noted a
plant of golden mouse-ear just coming into blossom.
Here they call it “grin the collar.” It is a wild plant
which the Elizabethan herbalist speaks of with affection,
and which he says he found growing in dame Bridget
Kingsmill’s ground, on distant downs, “not far from
Newberry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw also bursting into blossom roots of the old
single peony. It was of the sort that I have been told
must be gathered in the night, or else the ill-fated
gatherer may be struck blind.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some years ago, I remembered once asking for a
blossom of this sort in a cottage garden to copy in my
embroidery. But the old woman to whom the plant
belonged would not hear of picking a flower.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Best leave it—best leave it,” she had said. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
thought her churlish for the moment, and then thought
no more about it; but the same evening, whilst we were
at dinner, a blossom of the single peony was brought
in to me on a salver, and I was told that little Betty,
old widow Hodgkis’s granddaughter, had run up from
below the Edge “to pleasure me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Granny, said the child, had told her that “you’re
welcome to it, and that, bein’ as it is there, was no
ill-luck.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On being pressed to explain, the child had answered,
“Us dursn’t pick that blow early, but granny says, picked
at night, peonies be as safe as Job Orton in his shop,
but in noontime ’tis only suckin’ gulleys as wud pick
’em.” For some moments I could not get the reason
out of the little maid, but at last, when we were alone,
she whispered to me. “’Tis along of the ecalls. If one
war to see yer in the day, madder yer’d be than a tup
at Bridgenorth fair, and blind, behappen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There is also in Shropshire a lingering belief that
the seed of the single peony has magic powers to
soothe and quiet women. A young widow, who had lost
her husband in an accident connected with the blasting
of the lime rock, obtained sleep by drinking a tea made
from the seeds, I was assured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PHYSICIAN OF THE GODS</div>

<p class='c014'>“My Jane,” her mother said, “couldn’t sleep nohow
before. It was rocks, and falls in darkness, and
screams all the time with her, let her do what she would.
Her got fair tired of physic, nothing the doctor gave
her seemed to bring peace, or to padlock her tongue.
Then came Jill Shore,” I was told, “as lives halfway
up the heights of Tickwood. A witch some counted
her, and her made my Jane lie down, and her charmed
her with verses and made her drink a draught of
peonina seed. And Jane her fell asleep, like a lamb
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
beside its dam, and her slept, and slept, and woke up
reasonable and quiet, and for all she was mortal sad,
she was a decent soul again, and gave up screeching
and tearing out her hair, and screaming out things
not fit for a decent body to say.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then there was, at the end of the garden, a plant
of goat’s rue, and a patch of mustard seed. An old
writer declared that mustard would take away the
black and blue marks that come from bruises. How
that may be, I know not, but later on we shall take up
the crop, root and blossom, and dig in the plants as
manure into the fresh ground where we hope to grow
our tulips for next year. It is the best manure that
can be given to tulips, and an old secret amongst the
tulip growers of past centuries. Just beyond the crop
of mustard I saw a root of wild clary. In some of
the old herbals this plant was accounted an excellent
remedy for weak eyes, and Gerard tells us that it was a
common practice in his day to put the seeds into poor
folks’ eyes, to cure disease.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just by the door that led into the paddock, there
was a plant of woodruff. Very delicate and sweet is the
scent of this little flower. It grows in great patches
under the hazel trees of the Edge Wood. Formerly woodruff
was used in church decoration, and was deftly woven
into many garlands. In the north of Europe woodruff
is still used as a herb to flavour drinks. I never
heard of this being done in England, but in Shropshire
it is often culled in the farmhouses to put in muslin
bags, in the place of lavender. It has a sweet scent,
which remains with letters and kerchiefs like a memory
of the past.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then there was, I saw, a plant of wormwood, the
plant from which absinthe is distilled. In the sixteenth
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
and seventeenth century the leaves of this plant were
chopped up for flavouring, and it was thought an excellent
seasoning to venison. By the wormwood there
was a line of camomile. A little later in the summer
the plants will be covered with little white star-like
blossoms. Burbidge will cut stalks and flowers and his
wife will dry them in the sun, and give them away to
the parents of sick children. “My missus,” the old
man once said to me, “mostly does her kindnesses by
nastiness. Her will,” he added, “fair poison a body to
keep her alive.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But though Burbidge allows himself the privilege
of a free tongue as regards his wife’s remedies, he permits
no criticism elsewhere. On one occasion one of “his
boys” objected to a gigantic draught of ales-hoof and
mallow, flavoured with camomile. “What dost thee
stand there for, loselling?” was the vigorous rebuke I
heard addressed by my old friend, as the victim hesitated
to drink down at a gulp, a bumper of a frothy
brown fluid. “I tell thee, Roderick, if it fair blows off thy
stomach, it will make a new man of thee.” “I canna,”
feebly protested Burbidge’s man. But he had to; for
as my old gardener said, with a purple face of wrath,
“I and my missus don’t make physic for folks to chuck
abroad, and a man that works under, needs must drink
under.” Whatever the immediate effect of the awful
beverage was, I cannot say, but this I do know,
Roderick did not die; he even looked as usual a week
later.</p>

<p class='c014'>Few gardeners now have their herb plots, but through
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries ladies and their
waiting-women made household medicines, and administered
these themselves to the villagers, and to the
members of their households.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
Suddenly, whilst I was looking at my herbs and
thinking of how they were used in earlier days, the
garden door was thrown abruptly open and Bess danced
in before me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What a time you have been away!” she cried.
“I can’t run about, and only look at flowers or watch
idle birds. Hals is coming, that is what I have to
think of.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I went into the house after luncheon, my chair and
table were carried out, and I sat and embroidered. This
time I worked a cherubim’s face, who possessed long
locks and had dark-blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am going to give him chestnut hair,” I said; and
I looked out six different shades of reddish-brown to
produce the desired effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BESS TALKS OF HEAVEN</div>

<p class='c014'>“He ought to be pretty,” said Bess, who had seated
herself by me. “Good children should be beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why?” repeated Bess. “Why, because God could
never do with ugly little squinting things up there. He
wouldn’t want boys that had crooked noses and red
warty hands, and ugly eyes that didn’t look straight.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But suppose, Bess, the good children,” I urged,
to see what Bess would say, “had crooked noses, red
warty hands, and squinting eyes, what must be done
then?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, mamsie, you don’t understand heaven,” said
Bess, loftily, “but I and Prince Charming do,” and
she hugged her puppy. “We do. We know that God
can’t have ugly boys in His garden, or what would the
poor girl angels do? I know what heaven is like—beautiful,
beautiful,” and my little maid stood panting
with excitement before me. “All the flowers all out,
and all the fruit quite ripe, and you may pick what you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
like, and no cross Nanas ever make you wash, or go
to bed until you’re quite, quite tired.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you ever been there?” I asked, smiling at
my little girl’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Once,” said Bess. “Nana said I was asleep, but
I know better. The snow was on the ground, deep,
deep, but I wasn’t frightened, for when I looked out—and
I got out of bed all myself, when Nana was at
supper—I saw the stars, and I knew the angels were
close to me; and when I crept back to bed I said,
‘God make me good,’ and I didn’t sleep, but I went
to heaven, and that’s better than a picnic on the Edge,
or making toffee with Mrs. Langdale. So you see I
know there are no ugly people in heaven, because,
mamsie, I’ve been there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But in your philosophy, Bess,” I answered, “what
happens to poor people, sick people, old people, all the
people who have worked for God and done the work
of His kingdom here?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, God,” said Bess, softly, “God gives them all
prizes. When you give children prizes at the school,
they don’t get nothing more, but when God gives one
prize they get everything.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Everything?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Bess, “dolls, cakes, pups. And then
they play, and are always young, and they never have
rheumatics, not even colds or coughs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I kissed my little girl and told her to dream of
heaven again.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='ce-caption'>THE ORATORY.</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>A minute or two later, and Bess was off chasing a
butterfly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mama,” she said after a long chase, when she
returned to me with a scarlet face and dripping temples,
“do you know that Mrs. Burbidge’s nephew, Frank
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
Crossley, has brought her back a beautiful glass case,
and it’s full of butterflies—real butterflies. There’s a
beautiful blue one—all blue, and a red one, and a
yellow one, like the gorse you told me not to pick
because it was so prickly, and one green, like the Edge
Wood when you look below and can’t see a cornfield,
and can only hear flies buzzing. And do you know
Frank caught them all himself, and he stuck a pin into
each to keep them tight, and spread their wings as if
they were flying; but they can’t really fly for they’ve
always got to stay in his box.” Then, after a gasp, my
little maid put her hand in mine, “Mama, may I have
a net and a box, and some pins, for I should like to
have what Burbidge calls a ‘collection’?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you won’t like to hurt butterflies, Bess?” I
said. “Just think how horrid it would be to run pins
through them and to pin down their beautiful wings
in boxes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“STUPID LITTLE INSECTS CANNOT FEEL”</div>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” said Bess, “I suppose I shouldn’t like that
at first, but Frank doesn’t mind. I’m not an ignorant
little insect,” said Bess, loftily, “and you won’t make
me believe, mamsie, that stupid little insects can feel
like girls or boys.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not argue, for I am aware that the best
wisdom of the child comes sometimes from the silence
of the parent, rather than from the speech; but I felt
sure my words would come back later to Bess, and that
when she had had time for reflection, her better nature
would make her give up the wish to have a collection
of butterflies. Whilst we thus sat on, Nana swooped
down and captured Bess.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must wash your face and hands, miss, before
going to the station,” she said tartly, and at the same
time informed me that a poor woman was waiting
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
outside in the monk’s passage, who wished to speak
to me. “I can’t make head nor tail of what she
wants,” said Nana, sourly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A pack of rubbish and not a grain of sense, that’s
what we often feel about our neighbours’ sayings and
doings,” I answered. “But ask her to come and
see me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Milner disappeared, and in a few moments
reappeared, followed by a little brown, undersized
woman, with a mahogany skin, and wrinkled like a
walnut. Mrs. Eccles was a little hunchback, and had
come from the Dingle to see me. She walked a bit
lamely, and carried a stick. Mouse gave a growl, and
Prince Charming, who had rolled himself up on the edge
of my skirt, tumbled up with a snort, and a gruffle.
I begged the poor woman not to be afraid, told her to
sit on a bench close by, and asked her mission.</p>

<p class='c014'>“’Tisn’t no flannel, no, nor no dinners neither, not
even a packet of tea,” she answered. For a moment
Nana returned to fetch a ribbon or a tie—some lost
possession of Bess’s. On seeing her Mrs. Eccles remained
silent, for, as she whispered, “’twas a private matter.”
Then when Nana had disappeared, her courage returned,
and she blurted out, “I knows as yer have one, for all
Mr. Burbidge says. There always was one—one out
alongside of the walled garden.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt puzzled, but nodded and begged my old friend
to tell me what it was she had come for. But a direct
answer is not often to be got from the poor, you must
wait for an answer, as a dear old clergyman once said
to me, “as you must wait for flowers in an English
spring.” So I threaded my needle with a brilliant
brown, and Mrs. Eccles’s speech bubbled on, like a brook
in February.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. ECCLES’S MISSION</div>

<p class='c014'>“It be in this way, for I know this place, same as
the inside of my own kitchen,” she said. “Didn’t I
work here fifty years agone, in the old days? I
knowed this place,” she said, looking round, “afore it
war a haunt of the gentry, when it was farmer folk as
lived here, and when I war a servin’ wench, when I
scrubbed, and cleaned, plucked geese at Yule-tide, and
helped the missus in making mince-meat, and in making
butter for the market. I know’d it then, and I knows it
now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I tried to stem the old dame’s eloquence, for the time
I had at her disposal was limited; but my little old guest
was voluble, and I had to sit quiet to learn her mission.
At last light pierced through her discourse, and I discovered
that she had come down for a leaf, or a sprig, of
some plant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must come round and show me what it is you
want,” I said at last; and I covered up my embroidery
and prepared to take her to the herb plots in the kitchen
garden, as the most likely spot to find out what she
was in need of.</p>

<p class='c014'>But halfway, Mrs. Eccles stopped dead, shook her
head, and called out, “It never grow’d there, I be sure it
never did. I know it does there,” and she pointed back
to the Abbey, “for I have a-know it afore yer was born,
and, my dear, it war along top-side of the mound, at
back of the red wall, where the missus used to grow
her fever drinks, and where they put in cabbages for
Christians and cows alike.” As she spoke my funny
old friend turned her back on the kitchen garden,
and made for the quadrangle as hard as her old legs
would take her. Mouse and I followed hot-foot behind.
Suddenly Mrs. Eccles came to a dead stop at the foot
of a green slope, on which the red wall was built,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
and pointed with her black stick, at a green shrub
above her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There her be,” she cried triumphantly, “sure
enough, same as a galenny’s nest, snug and safe.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I scrambled up the bank, and Mouse followed with
a bound. The old body was almost breathless for
a minute, but went on pointing like a pointer at the
shrub.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it for?” I asked. The shrub in question
was a bay tree, and in a severe winter in the nineties,
had almost died, but last spring it revived somewhat,
and sent out a few weakly branches this summer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What does I want it for?” repeated Mrs. Eccles.
“Why I wants it for salvation; to save my boy from
the Lightning.” Then she went on to tell me, with a
burst of eloquence, about the Shropshire belief, to the
effect that a spray of bay-leaf, or a feather of an eagle,
if worn in a cap or hat, can preserve the wearer from
lightning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The big hawk’s feather, there’s none as can get
now,” she said. “The railways and the holiday-makers
have killed they, but they have left the bay trees.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I remembered having heard that Mrs. Eccles’s
husband, some forty odd years ago, had been killed
whilst haymaking, struck by lightning. “’Twas the
death of Job, his fork,” an old man had once told me.
“The lightning came clean down, and struck him by the
command of the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If my gude man had had but a sprig, he might
have been hearty now,” broke from Mrs. Eccles;
and she went on to tell me that her grandson, Joseph
Holroyd, “war goin’ to work for Farmer Church,
and that she had come here, for I know’d as you’d
provide.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
I opened the little knife on my chain, and cut off a
sprig and gave it to my old friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN OLD PAGAN BELIEF</div>

<p class='c014'>She bobbed low, and scuttled away. “Won’t you have
a cup of tea?” I called after her. But she shook her head,
and cried out, “Nay, nay, I have my widdies (ducks) to
feed;” and as I stood and looked, the little brown figure
disappeared up the drive. When I went back to the
east garden, I thought over my conversation with Mrs.
Eccles, and I recollected having read somewhere, that
the Romans believed that a phœnix’s feather, if it could
be obtained and worn in the bosom, would avert
disaster; and a learned friend once told me that the
Emperor Tiberius was much alarmed by thunder, and
always wore a wreath of laurel round his neck if the
weather was stormy, because he believed that laurels
were never blasted by lightning. So I reflected that my
old friend, bred amidst the wilds of Shropshire, held,
after all, unconsciously an old pagan belief, of which
the plume from the big hawk was only another version
of the phœnix’s feather, whilst the laurel and the bays
sprang, likely enough, from the same legend. Whilst
revolving the old beliefs of past empires in my mind, I
was called back to the present by Bess rushing up to
me, and calling out—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where have you been Mum, Mum? We shall
be late, I know we shall be late. And if Hals
didn’t find some one to meet him, what would he
say?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m sure I don’t know,” I said penitently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nor me,” retorted Bess, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c014'>So without more ado, my daughter, Prince Charming
and I walked up a golden field of glittering buttercups
to the station. We waited on the platform. The train
was late—when isn’t the train late in the country?—and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
Bess and I sat down on the long bench that faced
the line.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess seemed lost in a brown study. “A penny for
your thoughts, miss,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mum,” replied Bess, dreamily, “I am thinking and
thinking——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, dear?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is the use of London?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The subject is rather large, I urged. But Bess had
the sharp, incisive intellect of a quick child, and stood
firm to her opinion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t see,” she said, “that noise, shows, and smart
people make use. Why should poor children be taken
to London? If the grown-ups want it, they had better
go there by themselves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear little person,” I said, “even the youngest of
others must sometimes do disagreeable things, even in
the twentieth century.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But this was a hard matter for an only child to
understand, and Bess would have none of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the same moment, we heard the noise and rattle
of the approaching train, and our discussion broke off
abruptly. A second later the train had stopped, and
the guard alighted and opened a first-class compartment,
and proceeded to lift out little Hals. Bess dashed
up breathless. The children were too excited to embrace
each other. They only rushed to each other, took
each other’s hands, and went on dangling them, and
blushing like two rose buds. Whereupon so, Prince
Charming fell with a yelp to the ground. Happily, I
was by to pick up and console the poor little puppy. A
quiet, nice-looking young woman came out, bearing in her
arms a host of packages and rugs. In a minute or two
Hals’ luggage was collected, and we walked down across
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
the buttercup field to the old Abbey, whilst swallows flew
overhead, and sunshine chased purple clouds across the
sky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HALS ARRIVES</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> is not here?” I heard Bess say to Hals.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” answered Hals.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then,” whispered Bess, “I shall be able to pray
to-night. For all God lives so far, I think He can understand
a girl sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s handy,” agreed Hals, shortly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” answered Bess; “He knew what I wanted at
Christmas all of His own accord, and now He has left out
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span>, and He couldn’t have done better, even if He
had been papa.”</p>

<p class='c014'>To this, Hals made no answer, but both children
danced with glee. Then followed tea, and two hours
afterwards, bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>When my little girl was in bed, I went up and found
her, and said the last good-night. Her eyes shone like
little stars, and she put her arms round my neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mum—Mum,” she said, so I went quite close. “I
thought,” said my little maid, “when I had got Prince
Charming, that I never could want anything else, but I
do now want something bad—bad.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes?” I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is there nowhere,” pursued my little girl, “where
one can buy a brother? I want one so bad.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The children and I passed a happy week—a week of
golden sunshine. Miss Weldon went off and spent the
time with a cousin at Hereford, and I was left alone
with lad and lass. We read, and talked, and played.
There were no lessons, but I told them “lovely stories.”
Beautiful old legends, pretty tales from history, and I
read aloud from Hans Andersen, and parts of Charles
Kingsley’s delicious “Water Babies.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
“I think,” said Bess one day as I closed the book,
“that I love Tom best of all as a little sweep.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Hals, “for he was so game, running
across the moor all by himself. When I am a man, I
hope I shall never be afraid. I am sure my father
never is.” Then, after a pause, he added, “Some day
I shall be a soldier, and fight the king’s enemies.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So shall I,” said Bess.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this Hals would not allow. “Girls cannot
fight,” he assured me, gravely. “They can only scratch.
Besides, boys cannot fight girls, so it wouldn’t be fair.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I must fight girls,” said Bess, sadly; “but
I’m afraid that wouldn’t be much fun, for girls mostly
pinch, and run away.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The weather was beautiful during Hals’ stay with
us. The Shropshire fields and woods seemed all under
an enchanter’s wand. Blue mist lay on the Wrekin and
on the Clee. Sunshine glowed all the day, and in the
evening, glorious sunsets, and tranquil twilights. After
tea, we sometimes took Jill, the little pony, and the
children rode one behind the other along the lanes. All
the hedges were redolent with honeysuckle, and great pink
sprays of the most exquisitely lovely of all flowers, the
wild dog-rose, curled over branch and stem; whilst
larks sang over green seas of rippling wheat, which
moved in broad waves over stormless, summer seas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WE MEET THADY</div>

<p class='c014'>Far away I showed the children one evening the
Brown Clee, the land of witches and romance to Shropshire
youth. No rain fell, no tempests gathered. It
was June, and the perfection of June weather. Sheets
of buttercups glistened in the meadows, moon-daisies
nodded in the upland grasses, and over disused lime-kilns
blew beds of rosy thyme and rock-roses, whilst
here and there, on the outskirts of forest lands, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
found the sweetest of all wild flowers—pale butterfly
orchises, with their strange sweet perfume, which, as
Bess said, made you long to live, only in afternoons.
Thady one day joined us in one of our expeditions.
He got up from a bush suddenly as we were passing—bare-legged,
jovial, courteous, as only an Irish lad
can be.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The ‘top of the morning,’ mam,” he cried, and his
face lit up with a simultaneous smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is afternoon,” I laughed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Whatever the hour or the season, ’tis only well I
wish yer,” he replied, with the spontaneous politeness
of the Celt.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you anything pretty to show us?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” repeated Bess, “show us something pretty.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” said Thady, looking down, “it’s getting
late, I’m thinking, for seeing sights; most that’s young
is getting fledged. But I know a field where there’s a
lot of little leverets, soft as down, pretty as kittens.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So we followed on. I led Jill, with Bess riding on a
boy’s saddle, and Hals followed behind. We passed a
wild, rough field, with the steep pitch of the Edge Wood
on one side, and the view of a great stretch of country
up to Shrewsbury, and beyond. To the west we saw
Caer Caradoc and the Long-mynd sleeping in purple
haze. Then we passed through a hunting wicket, and
went into another rough-and-tumble field, with rampant
thistles, full of old disused lime-kilns, and sheep-nipt
bushes of thorns.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What lovely places to play in!” cried Bess, enthusiastically.
“Perhaps real gnomes and goblins live
there, and if we stayed till the church-tower clock
struck twelve, we might really see them in red caps.
The sort, mamsie, that you and I know. Perhaps,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
she added, “then they might bring us gold. You know
they do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Begorra!” cried Thady, indulgently, “if yer was
to come here at midnight, yer couldn’t count them for
jostling, the leprechauns and such like gentry. They be
plentiful as faiberries in Muster Burbidge’s garden in
August.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this Hals said gravely, “I should like to come
and see them one night, although I have never heard
my father speak of them. I don’t think he knows many
goblins at Westminster.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Westminster,” retorted Thady, magnificently, “is
a poor place for meeting anything but common men and
women.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we walked on in single file, for I had to guide
the pony with care, for the pitches on each side of the
path were steep and slippery. In one part of the field
there was a large round clump of white dog roses, such
as are often to be found in waste places, with brilliant
yellow stamens and bronze-coloured stalks and buds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think ’tis here as you’ll find, missie, the little
yellow fluffs at home,” said Thady.</p>

<p class='c014'>Evidently in the innermost recesses of the rose bush
there was a fine scent of something very good to the
canine mind, for Mouse pricked up her ears, sniffed
boisterously, and began to move her tail like a fox-hound
drawing a covert. Then with a great swirl and
pounce, she darted right into the brake, bending and
breaking all by her weight, and brought out in her
mouth a little ball of fluff. The poor little creature
screamed in terror, almost like a child.</p>

<p class='c014'>I rushed forward. “Mouse, Mouse!” I cried, “drop
it, drop it!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LITTLE HARE</div>

<p class='c014'>Mouse looked at me reproachfully out of her topaz
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
eyes, held it, but allowed me to pass my fingers between
her great jaws and to release the little captive. Great
was my delight to find that poor little puss was quite
unhurt, only very wet with my dog’s saliva.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat down, and Thady lifted off Bess from the pony,
and then the children flocked round to see the long-eared
little creature I was holding in my arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t it pretty?” I said, and held up the little
tawny ball of fluff. “Look what lovely brown eyes it
has, and what tender shades of buff and fawn are in its
long ears.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let us take him home,” cried Bess, enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But,” I asked, “how about Tramp and Tartar?
They would not be gentle like Mouse.” And I added, “It
was lucky that they did not come with us this afternoon.
They would not only have caught the little leveret,
they would have killed him, too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bess agreed. “They are very wicked for all their
nice ways.” And then she added dreamily, “I wonder if
terriers ever go to heaven.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Begorra! if it is the holy Mother that has a fancy
for the breed, I’ll be bound she gets them past St. Peter.
’Dade,” said Thady, “if I was the saint, I’d never shut
the door in a good bitch’s face.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” says Bess, after a little pause, “for all
terriers kill things, they love us badly; and, besides,
there may be rats in heaven.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How about heaven, then, being quite a perfect
place?” I asked, for I must plead guilty to a strong
dislike to rats.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mum, Mum,” answered Bess, impatiently, “you
must leave the poor Lord a few rats, or what would his
poor dogs do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I laughed and had no answer ready, for a child’s wit
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>
is generally the hardest to fight. The best being bred
by simplicity and kindness of heart. A minute later I
slipped back my little furry nursling into the rose-bush,
and we threaded our way across the fields.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we retraced our steps no bird sang, only the faint
barking of a dog in some distant farm reached our ears,
and away in the hollow came the far-off sound of distant
church bells. We walked along grassy fields, down dim
lanes, and beside the budding wheat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thady was to come down and get a slice of cake and a
glass of milk. “With raisins, real raisins!” exclaimed
Bess. The prospect of the feast opened his heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Begorra, I’ll tell you at last,” he cried, with a sly
chuckle, and he bubbled over with laughter. “You
shall hear all about the job. Yer leddyship,” continued
Thady, “has taught me to hate the thieving of a poor
bird’s nest, same as the blessed Virgin has taught me
to be a Christian.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I nodded in approbation, but did not quite understand;
but then that, as Bess says, “never matters, if
you’re not found out.” In a minute Thady went on—whilst
I led both children, mounted on old Jill—and
told me of an adventure of his.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was this ways,” he said. “Two gentlemen last
month came over from Manchester, and they put up at the
Raven. I watched them come, out of the corner of my
eye—and ’tis little,” Thady added, “that escapes me at
such times. So when they had been round the churchyard,
and peered at the ruins, as is the habits of town-bred
folks, I made so bold as to approach them. Indade,
I had kept, ever since they left the hotel, remarkably
near them. My mother watched me up the Bull Ring,
for she knowed that I had a bit of somethin’ up my sleeve,
and as I passed, lookin’ as dacent as a lad that had just
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
been bishopped, she whispered, ‘Ye spalpeen, what be
yer tricks?’ But I shook her off, as a lad of spirit
should, for when yer minded to have a bit of fun, give
yer mother a wide berth sure.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Such is the advice of Thady Malone,” and my little
friend drew himself up loftily, and spoke as one who
had solved a hard problem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RUN OF THE SEASON</div>

<p class='c014'>“I followed the gentlemen right enough,” he continued,
“and never took my eyes off them, but kept
on with them, eyeing and peering round, same as a
hawk above a clutch of chickens. And by their talk I
made out it was after specimens that they had come.
I crept round by a bush, and discovered, right enough,
it was after birds and eggs that they had journeyed;
and at last one of ’em, the tall, dark, lean ’un, he called
out to me, and he said to the fat, sandy-whiskered one
that was standing by, ‘Perhaps this lad could help us.’
Then he turned to me. ‘My lad,’ he said, ‘we want to
go over a bit of wild country, and to see a bit of wild
life. Take us to a wood that is known here as the Edge
Wood. They say rare birds still nest there. Hawks,
we’ve heard, some of the scarce tomtits, and one or two
of the rare fly-catchers, and we want to get some eggs.’
Said I to myself, ‘Thady, yer shall have fine sport.’ But
one of them, the lean ’un, had a nasty stick, so I said,
‘Thady, my man, be careful;’ but comforted myself
after a bit, for ’tis only on louts’ backs that sticks need
fall. Then I stood up and answered bold, ‘Is it the big
hawk that your honours want, or the fern owl, the
sheriff-man, or any other fowl?’ Begorra, and indade
yer leddyship, there was no fowl that I wouldn’t have
pretended acquaintanceship with. And they nodded, and
I nodded, and they, the fat and the lean, they winked,
and I winked, and they talked of eggs and fine prices,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span>
and they offered me shillin’s, beautiful silver shillin’s;
but I said I’d serve them for the pleasure, for though
silver is good, a bit antic is better. Besides,” added
Thady, gallantly, “what her leddyship has taught me,
I canna unlearn,” and Thady bowed to me with the
instinct of a born courtier.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So I started at a trot,” pursued Thady, “and I
sang out, ‘Gentlemen, I’m yer man,’ and I gave a bow
and then away, as hard as I could make the pace, and
they followed on, like two mad bullocks, or fox-hounds
in full cry, and away we tore, over the fields, up the lanes,
along the high-road where need be. On, on, I headed
’em like a young he-goat. I’m allus in training, and
they followed. I gave ’em a splendid lead over field
and fallow, and whenever the fat ’un panted bad, I told
’im to cheer up, for the fern owl and the great hawk’s
nests were just ahead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“At last they began to get a bit rusty. Like enough,
by the twinkle of my eye, they began to fear as their
cases would never get filled. So I shouted out, as if I
were leading the king’s army. ‘Keep up your peckers,
misters, a field more and yer’ll see the great hawk hisself,’
and so on up a sharpish pull. I looked back, and
saw ’em fair sick—the lean one coming on, but the fat
sandy ’un fit to burst. I stopped to catch the breeze, and
in the pause I shouted out, ‘Yer’ll find the nest with old
Bolas, or where folks says the crows fly at nights,’ and
I laughed; and then, begorra, I ran like the best Jack-hare
that ever I set eyes on. And when they guessed
I had had a bit of a spree, they didn’t take it kindly,
not at all, at all, but called out no end of bad words—words,”
said Thady, sanctimoniously, “that I never could
repeat in your leddyship’s hearing, and that shocked
even poor me. So I kept at a proper distance, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span>
stick that the lean gent had was a right nasty one,
and,” added Thady, “a wise man only stops to argue
with men of his own size. But I did hear they went up
to the station that evening, those two poor gentlemen
with never an egg or a grub in their cases, and the
porter did say that they made tracks to Manchester
like two bears with sore heads. ’Tis wonderful how
some folks can never see a joke.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NATURALISTS GO EMPTY AWAY</div>

<p class='c014'>“Few of us can do that when the joke goes against
us,” I answered laughing. “But I am glad, Thady,
that you played them a trick. Naturalists of that sort
are a pest. In the name of science, they rob our woods,
and exterminate all our rare birds and butterflies.
Every honest man’s hand should be against them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this Thady grinned all over, “Indade,” he said,
“I’ll remember yer leddyship’s words of wisdom to
my dying day, and never let go by a chance of honest
amusement.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So speaking we reached the old Abbey Farmery.
Hals and Bess, drowsy from their long expedition, were
lifted off the pony half asleep. We all had a standing
meal, which, as Bess said, was much better than sitting
down, because you never eat what you don’t want; and
then the young life vanished—Bess and my little guest
to bed, and Thady into the silent fields, and only Mouse
was left to keep me company. I agreed that evening with
the children, that it is very nice sometimes to have no
dinner, and to return to simple habits, because the sense
so of wood and field lingers longer with you.</p>

</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As late each flower that sweetest blows,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I plucked the garden’s pride;</div>
      <div class='line'>Within the petals of a rose,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A sleeping love I spied.”</div>
      <div class='line in22'><span class='sc'>Coleridge.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I wandered round the garden some ten days later.
It was July, the Queen of Summer in the North. I
heard the swish of the mowers’ scythes, as wave after
wave of blossoming grass fell beneath their feet. As
I looked, I noticed that the trees had taken a darker,
fuller shade of green, and that the apple and emerald
tints which delighted me so much in budding June,
had fled before the fierce days of full summer heat.
Although the lawns were still verdant, and such as you
could only see where the summer rainfall is great, all
traces of spring were gone. The polyanthus and
cowslips’ umbels were crowned with seeds, and the
narcissi in the grass had almost vanished. Birds,
that a few weeks ago were funny little fluffy creatures,
with orange, gaping throats, were now strong on the
wing. Tramp and Tartar pursued one day a thrush
across the lawn. I ran out of the house to save him,
but found, to my relief, that he could take good care of
himself. With a triumphant scream he flew to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
top of the high yew hedge. In vain the two little
terriers leapt and whimpered below, and besought him
to come down and be killed. For all he was young,
he was wise, and continued to sit on a twig, and to look
down on their efforts with complacent indifference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOSS ROSES IN BLOOM</div>

<p class='c014'>When I went into the walled garden, I found the
moss roses in full blossom. They are most beautiful,
the most delicate, perhaps, of all the roses. There was
an old-fashioned pink, such as one used to see at Covent
Garden Market years ago.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had in my row Blanche Moreau, an exquisite paper
white, Maître Soisons, another beautiful white, and the
crested and deep purple Deuil de Paul Fontaine. How
delicious they all were! Just a little sticky, perhaps,
but very sweet; especially an old cottage pink variety
that I was given from a garden at Harley, and the
name of which I have never known. The kind donor,
an old dame, I remember, told me, when she gave me
a cutting and I pressed for the name, that it hadn’t
no name as far as she knew, but that she called it her
“double sweetness,” for it was to her nose, she affirmed,
“honey and candy in one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I noted, bursting into bloom on the other side
of the path, rows of Chinese Delphiniums of all colours,
that Burbidge had raised from some seed sent to me
from a lovely Scotch garden in the far north. The
blossoms were of all colours. There were some of an
exquisite watery tender turquoise blue, some deep blue
de Marie, and others, a faint and celestial tint, as of
the sky on soft February days. Besides these there
were opal twilights, and darkest indigoes.</p>

<p class='c014'>I paused and looked down the Ercal gravel path,
and stood gazing at my forests of peonies. The English
ones were over, but round the clematises were masses
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
of the Chinese sorts. They were of all colours—crimson,
carmine, white, purple, cream, pink, rose. How wonderfully
beautiful they were, what satiny pinks, what
splendid roses, what creamy whites!</p>

<p class='c014'>In the borders I noticed a few plants of the beautiful
tree or Moutan peony, the most glorious kind of all,
but which had flowered rather earlier. My plants as
yet were small, but “Elisabeth” had had one blossom
of deepest scarlet. And I was led to hope that Athlete,
Comte de Flandres, and Lambertiana would be strong
enough next year to be allowed to flower.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few steps beyond I paused to look at my Austrian
briar hedge, which was then literally, a line of flame in
my garden. It was a glorious note of colour, and
planted next to the hedge were patches of purple peonies.
What a beautiful contrast the two made! one that
Sandro Botticelli loved. Then I made my way to a bed
of hybrid teas.</p>

<p class='c014'>These delightful roses, as has been justly said,
combine all that is best of old and new. Almost all of
them are sweet scented, and even in cold latitudes
they flower twice, freely, in each year. Amongst those
that I love best are Augustine Guinoiseau, and Camoens.
Beyond these, on the southern side of the
garden, extend my great bed of hybrid perpetuals,
which stand our cold Shropshire climate so bravely and
bloom often into late November. I stopped to admire a
beautiful specimen of the Earl of Dufferin that seemed
almost purple in its sombre magnificence, and felt
almost dazzled at the splendour of Éclair. Then I
paused to smell a Fisher Holmes, and gathered an almost
black rose, which Burbidge told me a few days ago was
a new rose to him, and was called the Black Prince.
Such a mysterious black rose as it was, with a faint
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
sweet distant smell, like new-mown grass after a summer
shower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IRISES AND ROSES</div>

<p class='c014'>Between each row of roses I have planted rows of
the beautiful English and Spanish irises in turns. These
bulbs, I find, like the damp and shade caused by the neighbourhood
of the bushes, and the effect of yellow, purple,
blue, and lavender, between the pink, red, and white of
the roses was enchantingly beautiful. Then I looked
upwards and was delighted to see that my Crimson
Ramblers and Ayrshire and Penzance briers were all
ramping away to my, and to their, hearts’ content
over their pillars, and covering their bowers and arches
with trails and clusters of glory. I call my arches and
bowers my garden in the clouds. Nobody quite knows
how beautiful the Crimson Rambler can be till they
have seen it against a background of summer sky.
Just out of the garden stretched the plantation of firs,
Scotch and Austrian, with a border of ribes, laurels,
hollies, and yews. The plantation is very small, but it
gives a sense of silence between the Abbey and the old
town.</p>

<p class='c014'>Before I returned to the house, I made my way
to my bed of annuals. They were on the southern
side of the greengages. How gay and gorgeous they
looked with a few orange-tip butterflies flying over
them. There were patches of African marigold, all a
blaze of rich velvety gold, pale Love-in-the-Mist, sea-tinted
and mysterious. Love-in-the-Mist is just such
a flower as one can imagine Venus wore when she
appeared for the first time from the depth of the sea
foam, with its curious shadow of green, and its sea-green
petals of blue. Then I had in full flower little
square beds of larkspur, raised from some wonderful
seed I bought from Messrs. Smith, of Worcester, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
had blossomed forth in a hundred shades of opalescent
beauty. There were shadowy unreal reds, and purples
of many shades and colours in one flower, and as I
looked at them, they recalled the wonderful draperies of
some Burne Jones figures in that great artist’s paintings
from the Idylls of the King. A little further off there
were lines of stocks of all colours, warm-tinted buff, like
the hue of Scotch cattle browsing on a moorland, primrose,
bluish rose, dusky red, and spotless white, with
creamy hearts. Then flame-coloured nasturtiums ran
along in places, black and brown, and twisted and
twined wherever there was a little space. At the end of
the long border there were patches of the primrose-tinted
sweet sultan, with its exquisite scent, mixed
with crimson cockscomb, over which old Gerard fell
into ecstasies, and wrote of the “gentle,” as he called
it, that it “far exceeded his skill to describe so beautiful,
and excellent a plant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before I returned to the Abbey, I slipped off to the
kitchen garden to ascertain what progress my sweet
peas had made. They were only as yet showing
buds and long tendrils, but in another month they
would be a glory of sweetness and brilliancy, I felt
certain. As I retraced my steps to the Abbey, I was
greeted by the children. During his visit to the Abbey
little Hals had lost his delicate look, and fine pink roses
bloomed on each cheek. He and Bess came dancing up
the path hand-in-hand, and the little fox-terriers
scampered behind them, joyously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am sure we have found something,” cried Bess,
excitedly. “Burbidge wouldn’t look because he’s been
stung by a bee. ‘But,’ I said, ‘you don’t hear all that
chattering for nothing. If only Thady were here we
should soon know.’ I wanted to run off to the Bull
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>
Ring to fetch him, but Nana said I wasn’t to mess
myself, as Aunty Constance was coming down to
luncheon to-day. Much she’d care! She knows I can
have as much soap as I like.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GARDEN MYSTERY</div>

<p class='c014'>“Much you’d use, miss, if you had your own way,”
I answered laughing. And then I turned and begged
Bess, pouting and looking rather irate, to show me
where there was this wonderful chattering.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is a secret,” cried Bess, “I am sure—a real
secret.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, without another word, we turned in through
the wooden door at the back of the great yew hedge.
As we entered I heard such a twittering and indignant
chirping, that I was thoroughly puzzled to guess
the cause. The children and I peered through the
branches.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There must be a cat somewhere,” I said. I have
read that birds will chatter round a sick cat or dying
fox, but I could discover no beast about. At our
approach, two brilliant greenfinches alone took flight
with a beautiful flash of apple-green wings, and vanished
into the recesses of the great walnut tree.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still the harsh discordant cries continued. Suddenly
I saw a nest.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A nest!” I cried, “and the noise comes from
there. What can it be?” I tried to touch it, but
the nest of moss and twigs was beyond my reach.
“We must get the steps and then we shall know what
makes the noise,” I said. “But only Mouse amongst the
dogs may see; Tramp and Tartar must be shut up in
the shed, for if the birds fluttered down or could not fly,
they would kill them, before we could save them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We shut up the terriers and fetched the steps. “I
wish,” I said, “that one of the boys”—as Burbidge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
calls them—“were here to hold them.” For the ground
at the back of the hedge was uneven, and it was difficult
to get the steps reared firmly up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll hold them, dear,” said Hals, politely. And
added with pride, “You know I’m very good at doing
any man’s job.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But as they were heavy and rather clumsy, being an
old-fashioned pair, I declined this and begged Hals to
get out of the way, for fear of an accident happening to
him. Then I mounted. I reached the summit of the
ladder and looked down into the nest. As I did so I
was conscious, at the “back of my head,” as Nana says,
that the children were watching me intently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it?” they cried breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw below me a greenfinch’s nest made out of
green moss and twigs and lined with cow’s hair, and in
it, filling almost the entire space, was a gigantic grey-barred
bird with an enormous mouth, which he opened
at me in great wrath. Nothing daunted, I stretched
out my hand to seize him, and obtained my prize; but
in the effort, of doing so, I overbalanced myself, the
steps clattered down with a crash, and I fell, bird in
hand, to the ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>In my endeavour to save the bird from harm, I came
in contact with a projecting piece of lime rock. I felt a
sharp pain in my right knee, and then a giddy, confused
sensation possessed me, and a hundred lights,
red, blue, and white, danced before my eyes. The bird
escaped from my hand and fluttered into the hedge with
a guttural cry. Hals and Bess approached me in terror.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mum, Mum, you’re not dead?” asked Bess. I saw
the little face twitching above me, and as she spoke,
hot tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no,” I whispered dreamily; and then all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
trees and the hedge seemed to mingle in a senseless
dance, and everything bobbed up and down before me.
But I did not entirely lose consciousness, for I heard the
children whisper together. At last Bess took Hals’
hand and came quite close to where I was lying.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They do not always die,” Hals said soothingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, not mothers,” Bess answered, with a gulp. But
my poor little maid looked white with fear—she was
trembling, and added, “But mothers <em>can</em> die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I tried to say something to reassure them, but all
my words seemed to die on my lips, and as I lay there
everything seemed to get further and further off, and to
become indistinct and unreal.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last Hals seemed to remember what to do in the
emergency. “Run, Bess, run, and get some one,” I
heard him say.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUSE’S ROUGH KIND TONGUE</div>

<p class='c014'>As the two children started off to the house, Mouse
gave a whimper, and I felt her rough, kind tongue
against my face. Then a mist gathered round me and I
remembered nothing more.</p>

<p class='c014'>In a little while, however, I heard voices. Kindly
Auguste led the way, talking volubly. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame est
morte,</span>” I heard him call out in theatrical tones. Then
old Mrs. Langdale followed, wringing her hands; then
Célestine, like a whirlwind; and Nana and Burbidge a
second later hobbled up across the lawn.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame, vite,</span>” exclaimed Célestine, and then
followed a string of proposed remedies in the most
astonishingly quick French. As she spoke, she tried to
raise me, but I could not move without acute pain; and
Mouse, watching my face, growled angrily. At this,
Burbidge forced himself to the front.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have done with your gibberish,” he cried, in a surly
tone. “For an English blow an English remedy. Yer
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
might have broken my steps, marm,” he said to me,
with a catch in his throat. Burbidge is full of kindness;
“but at times his tongue is as rough as pig bristles,”
as his old wife, Hester says, and just then he was
thoroughly angry with me for having hurt myself
chasing “mere wild birds, like a village loseller.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he called to his boys, and somehow, with their
aid, I got back to the house. The children were both in
tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She has broken her leg,” cried Bess. “Mothers
can, I know it, besides beggars and princes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Hals would not allow this, and said, with dogged
steadfastness, “Mothers don’t break like dolls, I know
that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For this remark Burbidge commended him. “Stick
to it, young squire,” he said; and then he bade Roderick
run for the doctor, like greased lightning.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a minute or two, Nana begged all to go out, and
took possession of the injured knee, and began to bathe it
with a decoction of arnica and boiled lily-root, which last
is an excellent remedy, still used in Shropshire, for cuts
or bruises. Gradually the pain diminished, and as I
lay, feeling much shaken and a little foolish, the doctor
made his appearance.</p>

<p class='c014'>He begged me to remain on the sofa, to rest, and
discontinue all exercise for the present; and before going
wrote out the prescription for another lotion. When he
had left, I weakly suggested I would use both, and hoped
for the best. But this “trimming” course did not
pacify Nana, who declared “he might say what he liked,
but Dr. Browne had no call to change her lotion.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After luncheon I felt better, and was carried out on
a sofa to the lawn on the east side of the house, some
favourite books were placed near me, and the letters I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
had received that morning. Burbidge was by that time
very penitent and full of compunction, now that he
was no longer terrified, and was sure that my leg was
not broken. He brought me a sprig of lavender, “to
have summat nice to sniff,” and assured me “that them
birds of mine in the aviary should be looked after proper;”
and added, by way of gloomy consolation, “I wouldn’t
let ’em nohow suffer, not even if you’d broken both legs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When Burbidge had left me, I took up my letters
sadly, and felt grieved that I must forego that week the
pleasure of calling on friends and of visiting their lovely
gardens, decked in the full glory of summer; and that
I could not see, as I had intended to do, the stately
garden of Cundover, the glowing borders of Burwarton, or
the splendour of the Crimson Rambler at Benthall. All
these beautiful things, as far as I was concerned, must
remain unseen, and flower their sweetness away in the
desert air.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not even my own garden might I visit, for my orders
were to lie down and not to put foot to the ground for
some days; so I said sadly to myself I must only <em>think</em>
of gardens. I remained therefore quite quiet, for the
children had both gone off to tea at the Red House, and
Mouse, and I were left alone, to enjoy each other’s society.</p>

<p class='c014'>I lay back amongst the cushions, and thought of all
the beautiful gardens that I had ever seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GARDEN OF MY CHILDHOOD</div>

<p class='c014'>My mind flew back to the old Hampshire garden,
where I had played as a child, with its glowing anemones
in May, its auriculas, and its golden patches of alyssum,
which we called as children, “golden tuft.” Its great
hedges of lavender, its masses of fruit trees, and its
big beds of hautbois strawberries all returned to me.
How well I remembered the quinces, medlars, and
mulberries, and a hundred other delights. I recollected
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
also, the groves of filberts and great coverts of gooseberries
and raspberries, where the old gardener used to
allow us to “forage,” as he termed it, for ten minutes
at a time, and never more, by his great silver watch,
presented to him years ago “by the earl,” in the first
quarter of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then how beautiful the walls were in summer and
autumn, laden with apricots, peaches, delicious black
figs, and later on, with beautiful pears of brilliant colours
and gigantic proportions.</p>

<p class='c014'>How carefully the fruit trees were trained—some in
toasting-forks and others to make perfect fans. And
then what beautiful long alleys of close-shorn turf there
were, and what plantations of beautiful standard roses
he grew for my mother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHIPTON GARDEN</div>

<p class='c014'>Then my mind flew back to the beautiful pleasaunces
of Highclere, just seven miles away. How magnificent
were the great cedars round the house, the masses of
gorgeous rhododendrons, and the wonderful beds of
azaleas. Then, amidst shady groves with sparkling
patches of sunlight, I remembered, also, beautiful examples
of the great tree or Moutan peony—the highest
and biggest bushes that I have ever seen; and across
the park, delicious Milford, with its islands of blossom,
its swans, and its sunlit lake. Gardens are great
pleasures. The state gardens of the world remain
with us as beautiful and wonderful pictures of the
tastes and manners of past centuries. They are the
living splendours of past ages. I recalled such examples
as Levens, Hatfield, Longleat, and Littlecote. Then I
turned in thought to homelier, what Bess calls, “more
your own kind of places;” and I thought of the lovely
little old manor-house gardens that I had seen. There
is one not far from Wenlock, by name Shipton. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
little terraced garden, with old stone vases of Elizabethan
time. The present house dates mostly from Mary
Tudor’s reign, and belonged later to Sir Christopher
Hatton, the Maiden Queen’s dancing Chancellor, who
won all hearts by his grace and amiability, it is said.
On each side of the little narrow garden run high walls,
festooned with roses—and such old-fashioned roses!
Old kinds that I have never seen elsewhere—such as
Waller might have thought of when he penned his
exquisite verses to Saccharissa—dainty, small, and
deliciously fragrant. Then, just outside the garden
are big bushes of brilliant berberries, that turn in
autumn, red, like a regiment of English soldiers in
peace-time, and that were so highly esteemed for the
making of “conserves,” in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c014'>How pretty such old-fashioned gardens are—very
tiny, very dainty, and meant to be very formal and trim.
They seem little worlds all of their own; little centres of
human care and affection, and outside all appears a
wilderness in comparison.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, as I lay idly back, looking into the blue mist
and enjoying the far green of the poplars, my mind
turned to all the lovely gardens that I had read about.
I thought of “that railit garden,” that James I.
of Scotland—poet, musician, and artist—loved; and
where he fell in love with the Lady Jane, the fair
daughter of the Earl of Somerset. There, he tells us,
he passed his deadly life—“full of peyne and penance.”
From a grim tower he first saw his lady-love. He tells
us in the “King’s Quhair,” how he saw her walking
in a fair garden, and how, in seeing her, “it sent the
blude of all my body to my hert;” and how, for ever
afterwards, “his heart became her thrall,” although
“there was no token of menace in her face.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span>
There, amidst “a garden fair,” by towered walls,
knit round with hawthorn hedges, where thick boughs
beshaded long alleys, and where the sweet green juniper
gave out its aromatic fragrance, he, poor poet-king,
sang of love, listening all the while to the “little sweet
nightingale that sat on small green twists, and that sang
‘now soft, now lowd,’ till all the garden and the walls
rung ‘right of the song.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I thought of that still garden at St. Mary’s
chapel, at Westminster, where the great father of
English poetry wrote his treatise on the “Astrolabe”
for his little son Lewis. I imagined him with his wise
and tender face, and far-off, deep-set grey eyes looking
out on the world kindly, serious, gentle.</p>

<p class='c014'>I liked to remember the great man’s peaceful deathbed,
and thought of his last sweet verses—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Flie fro the prese, and dwell with sothfastnesse;</div>
      <div class='line'>Suffise unto thy Goode, though it be small,</div>
      <div class='line'>For horde hath hate, and climbing tikelnesse.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is an old, old story, and yet always a new one; but
in Chaucer’s time, failure met with a sharp ending.</p>

<p class='c014'>I thought also of that fair garden near the Temple,
which our greatest poet has touched with the divine
intuition of genius, and made bloom with roses that no
frost can kill, or smoke can soil. Where Plantagenet
plucked the white rose of York, and Somerset the red one
of Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I thought of unfortunate Richard’s queen in
the garden at Langley, and of the old faithful, rugged
gardener and of his bitter cry of pity. “Here did she
drop a tear. Here in this place I’ll set a bank of rue,
sour herb of grace.”</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>CHAPTER HOUSE AT WENLOCK.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">BACON’S GARDEN</div>

<p class='c014'>Then I thought of Lord Bacon’s beautiful garden of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
“prince-like” proportions. According to him, the ideal
garden did not measure less than thirty acres, and was
to be divided into three parts—a garden proper, a
greene, a heath, or desert.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the garden there was to be a succession of flowers.
Germander, sweet briars, and gilly flowers, were some of
those named, and the garden was always to be gay. He
advocated many kinds of fruit, “cherries, rasps, apples,
pears, plummes, grapes, and also peaches.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the heath or desert, were to be planted thickets of
honeysuckle, and garlands of wild vine; while mole-hills
were to be skilfully covered with wild thyme, with pinks,
and in opening glades, sheets of violets, cowslips, daisies,
and beare-foot, were each to have their place. Then
long alleys were to be planted with burnet, wild thyme,
and water-mint, which, when crushed, would, he tells
us, “give out rich perfume.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Great Princes may add statues and such things for
state and magnificence,” wrote Bacon; “but beyond these
things is the true pleasure of a garden.” And there the
great Chancellor was right, for we all know little plots
and tiny greenhouses, worked and tended by loving hands,
where the owner, and toiler, gets more pleasure out of a
very small enclosure or a single frame, than a ducal
proprietor out of many acres of horticultural magnificence.
God is very just in pleasure, if not in wealth.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was in his own beautiful garden at Gorhambury,
that the great philosopher and master-mind wrote
much that was beautiful. His was a strange character.
He soared to heaven by his intellect, and fell to hell by
his baseness. Ben Johnson wrote, “In his adversity I
ever prayed that God would give him strength, for
greatness he could not want.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bacon, be it said in sorrow, was one of the last of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
the bench who descended to torturing his victims. He
wrote of the unfortunate Peacham, when he refused to
answer his questions, “that he had a dumb devil.”
Yet this man loved at other moments pure pleasures.
His love of a garden was real, and deep, and no man
understood more fully the heights and depths of the
Christian Faith, or the higher flights of redeemed souls.
“Prosperity,” he wrote, “is the blessing of the Old
Testament; Adversity, the blessing of the New, which
carrieth the greater benediction, and the clearer evidence
of God’s favour.” “Prosperity,” he declared, “was not
without many fears and distastes, and Adversity not
without comforts and hopes. Prosperity doth best discover
vice, but Adversity doth best discover virtue.”
Nobody has ever approached Bacon for his beauty of
expression. Shelley wrote of his style, “His language
has a sweet, majestic rhythm, which satisfies the sense
no less than the almost superhuman wisdom of his
philosophy satisfies the intellect.” Such natures as
Lord Verulam’s are difficult for commonplace mortals
to understand, for the head is of a god, and the feet,
those of a beast. The young or inexperienced might
call such men humbugs, or hypocrites; but, perhaps,
the real truth is, that such men possess dual natures.
In them is a spirit that knows the light, and seeks it,
as the Chancellor swore he would seek the light; but to
whom, also, the ways of darkness are not repellent, and
who cannot resist the favour of man, and the false
glamour of courts.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I thought of the fair gardens of history. I
imagined the splendours of Nonsuch, laid out by
bluff Harry, of which men said, “that the palace was
encumbered with parks full of deer, and surrounded
with delicious gardens and groves, ornamented with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
trellis works and cabinets of verdure, so that it seemed
a place pitched upon by Pleasure herself, to dwell in
along with Youth.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was also good to think of John Evelyn in his
plantings, and during his long rides. I thought of him
journeying in the south of France, along the Mediterranean
coast, enjoying the sight there of the vineyards
and olives. In fancy I beheld him scenting the orange
and citron groves, and stopping to gaze “at the myrtle,
pomegranates, and the like sweet plantations,” as he
passed villa after villa, built, as he said, of glittering
free-stone, which, in that clear atmosphere, made him
think “of snow dropped from the clouds, amongst the
verdure of the ilexes and perennial greens.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELIZABETH OF YORK’S BOWER</div>

<p class='c014'>Besides these fair gardens, I thought in the dawn of
gardening, of Elizabeth of York’s bower, “in the little
park of Wyndsor,” and I liked to dream of that arbour in
Baynarde’s Castle in London put up for her, by order of the
king. I should have liked also to have walked with Sir
Thomas More in that fair garden (probably his) from
which he imagined the one in his “Utopia,” where “we
went and sat down on a green bank and entertained one
another in discourse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I should have liked to have crept into the great
gardens at Hampton Court laid out by the great cardinal,
where “there was a flower garden to supply the queen’s
bower with roses, and where John Chapman, the most
famous gardener of his time, grew his herbs for the
king’s table.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I should have liked to have had the invisible cap,
and to have stepped past the guard and entered the
Privy garden, and have read the mottoes on the sundials,
and to have slyly scented the roses, and pinched
the rosemary, juniper, and lavender.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
Had I possessed the magic cap, I should not have
forgotten to wander into the Bird garden and to have
seen “the beestes,” holding in stone their vanes; and
I should have liked also dearly to have seen all the
strange animals, amongst which there were harts,
badgers, hounds, dragons, antelopes, and one stately
lion.</p>

<p class='c014'>Could I have walked there, perhaps I might have
caught a glance of that “sweetest lady from Spain”
whom Shakespeare honoured most of all women; or
perhaps in the joyous hey-day of her youth have met
Anne of the slender neck, for whom Fate had reserved
so terrible a fate, although for a time all seemed to go
so smilingly with her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I should have liked to have been a favourite
guest at Moor Park, in the days when the stately Countess
of Bedford lived there, and to have heard the wits talk, and
perhaps have followed the countess and Doctor Donne
up the trim gravel walks, and have admired the standard
laurels, and rejoiced in the stately fountains in a
garden that, in the words of the great Minister of the
Hague, “was too pleasant ever to forget.” I should have
liked also to have walked into Sir William Temple’s own
garden at Sheen, had a chat with him about his melons,
of which he was so proud, or have paced with him the
trim alleys of his own Moor Park in Surrey. Later, I
should have liked to have seen his stiff beds, reflections
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterres</span></i> of Holland, and have heard from his
own lips the account of the Triple Alliance. And beyond
this garden of men’s hands, I should like to have seen
the glorious extent of firs and heather that enclosed his
garden, and to have heard the murmur of the distant
rivulet, and to have felt the charm of the distant view
that he gazed upon.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
Perhaps even, if fortune had been kind, I might have
seen Lady Gifford in all the splendour of silk or satin,
or heard some brilliant witticism from the lips of young
Jonathan, or even have caught a fleeting glimpse of
lovely Stella.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now all these pretty, all these interesting shades of
the past are gone. Yet Sir William’s sundial still stands
in his favourite garden, and below it lies buried his
heart, placed there by his own desire, whilst the rest of
his remains lie in Westminster Abbey, beside those of
his charming wife, Dorothy Osborne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GARDENS OF THE EAST</div>

<p class='c014'>No sound anywhere, on this lovely July day, greeted
me, but the trilling jubilation of a thrush in a lilac, so I
could dream on at will about gardens and their delights.
After a while my mind wandered to the gardens of the
ancients. I thought of those deep groves where Epicurus
walked and talked, of the rose-laden bowers where
Semiramis feasted and reposed, of the moonlit gardens
where Solomon sung his Oriental rhapsodies, where
fountains played day and night, and in which hundreds
of trees flowered and fruited.</p>

<p class='c014'>Where were the gardens of “the Hesperides?” I
asked myself. That spot of wonderful delight which
none ever wished to leave, where flowers blossomed all
the year, and where fair nymphs danced and sang
through all the seasons.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then where was the garden of Alcinous, where the
trees formed a dark and impenetrable shade, where
fountains refreshed the weary and where fruit followed
fruits in endless succession?</p>

<p class='c014'>With us in England, a garden means a place of
joyous sunlight, a place where flowers glitter in the
sunshine, and where throughout the day feathered
songsters sing in joyous chorus. In the Oriental
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
imagination, a garden means cool alleys, flowing water,
marble basins; a place to wander in beneath the stars,
and to hear the nightingale sing his chant of melody
and grief. Even in the matter of gardens, the aspirations
of the West must always be different from those of the
East. Then my mind turned to the gardens of fancy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where sprang the violet and the periwinkle rich of
hue”—where “all the ground was poudred as if it had
been peynt, and where every flower cast up a good
savour.” Where amongst the trees “birdis sang with
voices like unto the choir of angels, where sported also
little conyes, the dreadful roo, the buck, the hert, and
hynde, and squirrels, and bestes small of gentil kynde.”
Where sweet musicians played, and where, as Chaucer
wrote, with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naiveté</span></i> of the early poets, that God who
is Maker and Lord of all good things, he guessed, never
heard sweeter music, “where soft winds blew, making
sweet murmurs in the green trees, whilst scents of every
holsom spice, and grass were wafted in the breeze.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then in the peace of that exquisite summer day, I saw
as in a dream that blest region which Sir Philip Sidney
has painted and called Arcadia, “where the morning
did strew roses and violets in the heavenly floor against
the coming of the sun, where nightingales sung their
wrong-caused sorrow;” where the hills rose, their proud
heights garnished with stately trees, beneath which
silver streams murmured softly amidst meadows enamelled
with all sorts of eye-pleasing flowers. Where
pretty lambs with bleating outcry craved their dam’s
comfort, and where a shepherd-boy piped as though
he never could grow old, whilst a shepherdess sang and
knitted all the while, so that it seemed “that the voice
comforted her hands to work, and the hands kept time
to the voice music.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
In that sweet and happy country, where light and
sun and blue sky were constant joys, where the houses
were all scattered, “but not from mutual succour,”
where the joys of “accompanable solitariness were to
be found combined with the pleasures of civil wildness,”
I allowed my fancy to linger.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then as butterflies flitted past in all the pomp of
summer splendour in my Abbey garden, I thought for a
moment of Mistress Tuggy’s bowers of passion-flower at
Westminster, of which Gerard wrote, and of which he
told us “there was always good plenty.” I thought also
of that gay procession to the Parson of Tittershall, where
merry maids went, bearing with them garlands of red
roses, and of that wreath laid through many centuries,
in beautiful Tong Church.</p>

<p class='c014'>I liked to imagine Theobalds, where it was said a
man might wander two miles and yet never come to the
end of the great gardens; or to think of that great
pleasaunce of Frederick, Duke of Würzburg, where it
was said that it was easy for a stranger to lose his way,
so vast was the space of the enclosure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELIZABETHAN GARDENS</div>

<p class='c014'>Then I should have liked to have known the great
gardens of Kenilworth, where proud Dudley entertained
the Maiden Queen.</p>

<p class='c014'>There, according to Master Humphrey Martin, every
fruit tree had its place. In the centre of the pleasaunce
stood, he wrote, an aviary and a fountain of white marble,
where tench, bream, and carp, eel and perch “all did
play pleasantly,” and “beside which delicious fruits,
cherries, strawberries, might be eaten from the stalk.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the Elizabethan garden men were not content
with gay blossoms alone; sweet odours were necessary
to complete their standard of delight.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bacon wrote, because the breath of flowers is “farr
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
sweeter in the air, where it comes, and goes, like the
warbling of music, then in the hand, so there is nothing
more fit for delight than to know what be the flowers
and plants that doe best perfume the aire.” He recommended
amongst other sweet scents, two specially, that
of violets, and the perfume of dying strawberry leaves,
“an excellent cordial in autumn.” He also mentioned
the perfume of sweet-briar, and recommended that wallflowers
should be planted under a parlour or lower
chamber window.</p>

<p class='c014'>Andrew Borde, writing in the same century, declared
that it was deemed necessary for the country house of
his time to be surrounded by orchards well-filled with
sundry fruits and commodious, and to have a fair garden
“repleat with herbs aromatic and redolent of savours.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Markham also talked of the nosegay garden, which
was to be planted with violets, and gilly-flowers, marigolds,
lilies, daffodils, hyacinths, “tulipas,” narcissus,
and the like. There were to be knots, or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterres</span></i> of
delightful interlacing patterns, and amongst the ribbon
borders such sweet plants and flowers as thyme, pinks,
gilly-flowers, and thrift, all neatly bordered and edged,
with turrets and arbours to repose in.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thomas Hill, writing in 1568, also suggested that
there should be <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterres</span></i> filled with hyssop, thyme,
and lavender, for the pleasure of the perfume. In the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries folks sought their
flowers in their gardens, which it can well be imagined
was a much healthier form of enjoyment than the
modern one of masses of flowers in stuffy rooms and
of having tables laden with strong-smelling blossoms,
during hot and crowded banquets.</p>

<p class='c014'>The delight in the garden was essentially a sixteenth
and seventeenth century pride. Lawson exclaimed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
“What can your eye desire to see, your ear to hear,
your mouth to taste, or your nose to smell, that is not
to be had in a garden, with abundance of beauty?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lawson also loved the birds, as did the Scotch poet
king, and Chaucer, and, in the early nineteenth century,
Shelley and Keats. He wrote lovingly of a brood
of nightingales that turned his orchard into a paradise.
“The voice of the cock bird,” he declared, “did bear
him company, both day and night.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I should have liked to have visited Gerard in
his physic garden in Holborn, overlooking the Fleet,
and how delightful it would have been to have had a
chat with the old man, or to have brought him some
new plant or flower.</p>

<p class='c014'>Or perhaps, if fortune had smiled upon me, I might
another day have popped in and got a talk with John
Tradescant, whose father and grandfather were both
gardeners to Queen Bess, and who himself was gardener
in his time, to ill-fated Charles I. These
Tradescants travelled all over the world in search of
plants for the royal gardens, and one of them even
went to Virginia in order to bring back new specimens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHERE ARE THE GARDENS OF THE PAST?</div>

<p class='c014'>Where are the gardens of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries? A few are the delight and joy of our
own time, but most of them have perished, and are gone
like the roses that Sir Philip Sidney picked for Stella,
or the anemones that John Evelyn loved. The press of
human feet has displaced nearly all the fair floral sites
in London, and the hare and the partridges rove over
many of those famed in Tudor and Stuart days in the
country.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of Nonsuch, Evelyn wrote, “they cut down the fair
elms and defaced the stateliest seat that his Majesty
possessed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>302</a></span>
Alone, near High Ercall, at Eyton, where George
Herbert’s mother was born and bred, stands the old
gazebo or pleasure-house that belonged to the ancient
hall of the Newports. This still remains in red brick,
a lovely sixteenth-century building. The old house has
perished, and the old gardens have gone back into
plough, or meadow-land. Alone the old pleasure-house
stands and a gigantic ilex, which is said to have been
planted at the same time.</p>

<p class='c014'>Did “holy Mr. Herbert” ever pace that old pleasure-house,
I have often asked myself, as a little lad? It is
a pleasant thought. All loved him. Lord Pembroke,
his kinsman, told the king, James I., that he loved him
more for his learning and virtues than even for his
name and his family, and all men sought his friendship.
Amongst these the learned Bishop of Winchester and
Francis Lord Bacon. Was it of such a man that the
great essayist wrote, “A man having such a friend hath
two lives in his desires”? If so, it was of the immortal
side of life he spoke, for all George’s aspirations were
for the treasure where “neither moth nor rust can
corrupt, and where no thief can break through or steal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I let my fancy linger for a moment in the old
bowling-green at Whitehall, all gone too; I thought
of the prisoner, Sir Richard Fanshawe, in the chamber
above: and of his devoted wife, standing morning after
morning, whilst the rain fell in torrents, talking and
listening with the desperation of love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MASQUE OF FLOWERS</div>

<p class='c014'>The shadows deepened, the sunlight faded, and the
glory of red melted away into tender lavender and green.
After a while I think I got drowsy, for in my imagination
I saw a garden, gorgeous and resplendent. Loud music
resounded within its precincts, and a pleasaunce extended
before me of strange and fantastic beauty. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
the centre I noted a beautiful fountain, reared on four
columns of silver, with four golden masked faces, from
whose lips clear water issued in sparkling streams.
There were also curious beasts of gold and silver, in
the shape of lions and unicorns.</p>

<p class='c014'>The magic garden was hedged in with a sombre hedge
of cypress. On the whole scene fell the brilliant glare
of flaming torches. Gorgeous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterres</span></i> of tulips, all a
blaze of blossom, flashed with a hundred colours, whilst
to me, borne on little eddying breezes, came wafted back
the delicious sweetness of honeysuckle and eglantine.
Then, as I looked, to the sound of lutes and to the tinkle
of old stringed instruments, I saw nymphs clad in rich
apparel dance a stately measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>My book slipped off my knees, and fell with a flump
upon the grass. A minute later I rubbed my eyes and
laughed, and then remembered that I had not been
to fairyland after all, as Bess would have said, but
that I had fallen asleep, and had been dreaming about
the Masque of Flowers, a great <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> that was given in
honour of the marriage of the Earl of Somerset and
the Lady Frances, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, by
the gentlemen of Grays Inn, in the long past year of
1613. I laughed, for I really believed, as the children
say, it was all true, and Mouse, suspicious probably by
my puzzled look, gave a long deep growl. My faithful
friend had never left my side. Since my accident she
had remained with me, troubled, and annoyed and sullen
to everybody else.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mouse had a bad opinion of the doctor (most dogs
have). She did not like his carriage, and thought badly
of his coachman. Just then the world for her was full
of evil characters, and they taxed narrowly her powers
of observation.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>
As I leant over the sofa to pick up my book, the
oak door of the chapel hall was flung violently open,
and the two children, Bess and little Hals, danced in
together.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, mamsie!” they cried, for Hals had caught up
Bess’s manner of addressing me. “Such fun! such fun!
We did all kinds of things. We played games in the
garden—Kiss in the Ring, Stag a Roarning, Bell Horses,
Draw Buckets, and Shrewsbury Blind Man’s Buff, Wallflowers,
Garden Jumps, and heaps of others. Aunty
Constance called them ‘Shropshire games.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Were they good games?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>The children were too excited to speak, but nodded
their heads furiously, whilst their eyes shone with
excitement.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you repeat to me any of the rhymes?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hals can,” answered Bess; “I can’t long remember
poetry. Things fly into my head, but they soon fly out
again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I turned to Hals, and begged him to tell me those
that he could remember.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='illus-300'>
  <img src='images/illus_351.jpg' width="300" height="436" id='i351'

<p class='le-caption'><i>Photo by Frith.</i></p>
<p class='ce-caption'>OLD WENLOCK TOWN.</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” he replied, “I’ll try. Anyway it was great
fun. Aunty Constance taught us a lot, but most of the
children came from her class, and, besides, they knew a
lot. Shropshire children, I think, even <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fräulein</span> would
call ‘very learned.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They were all funny,” cried Bess; “and we danced
on the grass, and Aunty Constance gave us sugar-plums,
and red lolly-pops between the games, and we
drank lemonade and orangeade.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Hals, grandly; “I don’t think even the
king, or my father could have amused themselves better.
They know how to be happy in Shropshire.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
Then Bess interrupted Hals and called out sharply,
“Amuse mama.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD SHROPSHIRE GAMES</div>

<p class='c014'>“Do,” I said; “and begin by telling me all about
the games, and repeat to me all the rhymes that you
can remember.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, we must,” said Bess, moved to pity, “for poor
mama, she didn’t even go to Aunty Constance’s garden,
although she was asked, or see Aunty Constance’s new
flower with a long name that I am sure I can only misremember.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a pause. Then Hals stood on the gravel
path some five yards away, and said modestly, “I’ll do
my best, but I am afraid all the games won’t come back
to me. The first time you play at games, they are
almost as hard as sums.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no,” interrupted Bess, contemptuously.
“Games can never be as bad as sums, for you can
kick about and swing your feet in games. But in
sums it’s always ‘keep quiet;’ and then,” added Bess
sadly, with a note of pathos in her voice, “sums will
always keep on changing, unless they are done by a
governess.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then a hush fell upon us all, for Hals said he must
try and think of the games pat, and we were silent. I
saw Hals’ lips move, and a pretty vision rose before me
of a little figure clad in green velvet, with fair flaxen
curls clustering round his brow and resting on his lace
collar. After a few minutes the little boy stepped a
little nearer, and in a treble key, began to explain the
character of the old games and to recite some of the old
verses that once delighted lad and lass of the far West
country.</p>

<p class='c014'>“First we played Kiss in the Ring. We ran about,”
he explained, “and the boys dropped handkerchiefs on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
the shoulders of the girls they liked, and they said in
turn—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I wrote a letter to my love</div>
      <div class='line'>And on the way I lost it;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some one has picked it up,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not you, not you, not you.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>That they said,” said Hals, “when the boys didn’t like
a girl. I didn’t play,“ he remarked grandly, ”because
I didn’t like being kissed by strange girls; so I played
with the others at Cat and Mouse, which is better, for
the kissing is understood.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And after that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, after that we played Bingo.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bobby Bingo,” corrected Bess, severely. “You
should call things by their proper name, Hals.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was a game about a dog, and we came up, and
all said together,” continued Hals unmoved—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘A farmer’s dog lay on the floor,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Bingo was his name O.</div>
      <div class='line'>B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Bingo was his name O.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I cannot exactly say how that was played,” said Hals,
puzzled, “but we danced and we sang, and one girl
stood straight up in the middle, as if she had a punishment
lesson to say. And when I’m grown up, I will get
my father to buy me a dog, and I will call him Bingo.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now I want to talk,” cried Bess, impatiently,
“because I, too, know some of the games. We’ve often
played at them, Nana and I and the maids, on Saturday
afternoon when it was wet. There was Bell-horses. Nobody
is so silly, mamsie, unless it’s members of parliament
or governesses, as not to know ‘Bell-horses.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then my little maid slipped off the wooden bench on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
which she had been swinging her feet, and went and stood
by little Harry.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Listen,” she cried, and blurted forth at double quick
pace—</p>

<div class="sidenote">BELL-HORSES AND OTHER DELIGHTS</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Bell-horses, bell-horses, what time of day?</div>
      <div class='line'>One o’clock, two o’clock, three and away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bell-horses, bell-horses what time of day?</div>
      <div class='line'>Two o’clock, three o’clock, four and away.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then we stood up, and cried out—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Five o’clock, six o’clock, no time to stay.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>At this point Hals came and sat quietly by me on the
edge of my sofa, and Bess went on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Besides that we had Green Gravel, Green Gravel,
and even Mrs. Burbidge says that is not a wicked game
to play,” cried Bess; and repeated the old lines with a
funny little tilt of her head—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Green gravel, green gravel, the grass is so green,</div>
      <div class='line'>She is the fairest young lady as ever was seen.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll wash her in milk,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I’ll clothe her in silk,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I’ll write down her name</div>
      <div class='line'>With a gold pen and ink.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Then came what Bess called “them that laughed,”
who said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘O Sally, O Sally, your true love is dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sent you a letter to turn round your head.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“I like that,” remarked Bess. “The words are pretty.
‘Green gravel, green gravel,’ but I shouldn’t like to be
washed in milk, soap and water are bad enough, but I
should like letters to be written with a pen of gold.
They sound as if they ought to be letters all about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_308' id='Page_308'>308</a></span>
holidays or Christmas presents; leastways, they never
ought to be rude or disagreeable, or have anything to
do with lessons.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” agreed Harry, “written only for fun, and
because everybody may do as they like.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we discussed Wallflowers. And as the children
stood talking, for Hals had run to Bess’s side, old
Nana came out of the Chapel Hall and joined our
group.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is time, mam, for them to be in bed,” said Nana,
sourly; “and I’m sure it will be a mercy if both childer
are not ill to-morrow. By their own accounts they’ve
eaten as many lolly-pops as they had a mind to. I did
think as Mrs. Legarde had more sense than that. But
them as feasts children, should physic ’em.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wallflowers, wallflowers,” interrupted Bess, rudely.
“Come and amuse mama, poor mamsie hasn’t had tea
out, or done anything to please herself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So old Nana—whose bark, all the household acknowledges,
is far worse than her bite—came and began to
recite the old rhymes of her youth, and of the old days
before that.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am just ashamed of the old nonsense,” she said,
blushing like a girl, “but since it will amuse your
mama,” and she turned to Bess, “I’ll try my best.” And
Nana, in a funny old husky voice, with the Shropshire
accent growing stronger and stronger at every line
repeated—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Wallflowers, wallflowers, wallflowers up so high,</div>
      <div class='line'>Us shall all be maidens, and so us will die.</div>
      <div class='line'>Excepting Alice Gittens—she is the youngest flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>She can hop, and she can skip, and she can play the hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Three and four, and four and five,</div>
      <div class='line'>Turn your back to the wall side.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
And thereupon old Nana, animated by old recollections,
turned her back upon me and stood facing the old
bowling-green.</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUEEN BESS’S GAME</div>

<p class='c014'>“Well done!” cried both children simultaneously.
And then Bess called for “Nuts in May.” “You know,
what we played last Christmas, when we could’nt go
out,” she explained, “because the snow was so deep.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment Nana looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You ought to recollect that,” cried Bess, “because
it was you that learnt us it before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Nana thought for a minute, and then repeated the
old Shropshire version of the ancient game, which,
tradition says, was written by Queen Bess one Christmas
time for Lord Burleigh’s children. But Nana first of
all explained to us the action of the game.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must know, mam,” she said, “that there are
two parties—one of lads and the other of lasses.”
“The first come up and call (the lads)—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Here we come gathering nuts in May,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nuts in May, nuts in May,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here we come gathering nuts in May</div>
      <div class='line'>On a cold and frosty morning.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then the second lot,” as Nana called the lasses,
“answer back, and shout—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Who have ye come to gather away?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And the first lot (the lads) reply—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘We have come to gather sweet Maude away.’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘And who will you send to fetch her away?’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘We’ll send Corney Rodgers to fetch her away.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then the two parties pull,” she added, “and in
the end a lass has to leave, and to go over to the lads’
side.”</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_310' id='Page_310'>310</a></span>
“Who was sweet Maude, and who was Corney
Rodgers?” I asked of Nana.</p>

<p class='c014'>But she declared she didn’t know for certain, “but
most-like he was some bad bold man who lived in
the hills, and took off any maid he had a mind to.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go on, go on!” cried the children enthusiastically,
and clapped Nana vociferously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You know them all,” exclaimed Bess, “although
you like pretending; but nurses always do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this Nana, for all her head of snow, fell a
laughing. She forgot all about “bedtime,” and stood
before us with pink cheeks, whilst she exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c014'>“They comes back! They comes back, the old
plays.” And therewith begins to repeat “Here comes
Three Dukes a Riding.” “Us used to play that—and
a right pretty game it was,” she explained,—“on the
village green, when the leaves were budding, betwixt
the hours of school.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And she recited aloud in her dear, funny, old cracked
voice—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Here comes three dukes a riding</div>
      <div class='line'>With a ransome, dansome, day.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then the lasses used to answer,” she told us, “and
cry out—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘And what is your intent, sirs, intent, sirs?</div>
      <div class='line'>With a ransome, dansome, day.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“At this the lads used to shout—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘My intent is to marry, to marry.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“And the maids would reply—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Will you marry one of my daughters, one of my daughters?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then the lads used to look highty-tighty, for all
they had in their bones only the making of ploughmen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_311' id='Page_311'>311</a></span>
ditchers, and shepherds,“ Nana declared, “and they
would say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘You be as stiff as pokers, as pokers.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And turn up their noses and strut back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then the maids would answer, mincing like—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘We can bend like you, sirs, like you, sirs!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then the lads would scan the lasses up and down,
and sing back, as if every one of ’em had been born
a lord, or high sheriff of the county at least—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘You’re all too black and too blowsy, too blowsy</div>
      <div class='line in4'>For a dilly-dally officer.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then the maids would sing with a bit of spite—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘We’re good enough for you, sirs, good enough for you.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then a lad would leave his fellows, and say with a
shrug of his shoulders, and crestfallen like—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘If I must have one I will have this,</div>
      <div class='line'>So away with you my pretty miss.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>And then old Nana told us that the maids would
laugh and the lads would jeer, for in turn each lad had
to choose a lass, and sometimes the lass he had a mind
to wouldn’t go.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RING OF ROSES</div>

<p class='c014'>Then Nana, after a short pause, said, “Then there
be another game as us used to play. Ring of Roses,
some used to call it, and others Grandfather’s Rheum.
But I cannot remember but one verse—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘A ring, a ring of roses,</div>
      <div class='line'>A pocket full of posies.</div>
      <div class='line'>One for Jack, and one for Jan</div>
      <div class='line'>And one for little Moses.</div>
      <div class='line'>A-tisha, a-tisha, a-tisha.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_312' id='Page_312'>312</a></span>
and the fun was who could sneeze loudest. I remember
Mike Mallard and Mary Wilston was wonderful at it.
‘Yer’ll die in a sneeze,’ folk used to tell them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nana can you think of no more, just one more.”
For Nana had beckoned to Bess to say good night
and go.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I said, “just one more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So old Nana yielded to our united pleadings, asserted
it must be only <em>one</em>, as it was high time for her lad and
lass to be in bed, and ended by reciting aloud a strange
old Shropshire rhyme—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Walking up the green grass,</div>
      <div class='line'>A dust, a frust, a dust.</div>
      <div class='line'>We want a pretty maid</div>
      <div class='line'>To walk along with us.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“The lads used to say that in a chorus,” Nana
explained. “Then the maids would answer—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Fiddle faddle—fiddle faddle.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Then the boys would say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘We’ll take a pretty maid,</div>

      <div class='line'>She shall have a duck, my dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>She shall have a lamb,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hers shall be a nice young man,</div>
      <div class='line'>A-fighting for her sake.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Suppose this young man was to die,</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave the lass alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our bells would ring, and we should sing</div>
      <div class='line'>And clap our hands together.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“And the maids said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Fiddle faddle—fiddle faddle.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_313' id='Page_313'>313</a></span>
“I don’t like it,” said Bess, impulsively. “Why
should they all be jolly because the poor gentleman
died?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THERE’S THINGS AS GIRLS CAN’T UNDERSTAND”</div>

<p class='c014'>But Hals did not take that view. “There’s things,”
he said loftily, “as girls can’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this Bess turned very red, and in the spirit of
the modern woman declared, “What she couldn’t understand,
Hals couldn’t neither.” And in deep dudgeon
she followed Nana into the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the little party passed out of the garden Hals
called back to me, “We’ve forgotten Stag a Roarning.
The best of all the games we’ve not told you about.
One that I played last year with my papa at a school
feast.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The twilight turned into night. The servants came
out, and I was helped back to the Chapel Hall. After
all it had not been a dull afternoon. One can go many
miles in one’s room, if one knows how to ride on the
wings of fancy, and many is the garden that I had
visited that day, borne along on the pinions of imagination,
for were not the gardens of all time open to me?
No dragons or mailed warriors guarded the entrance
gates, not even a modern policeman.</p>

<p class='c014'>An hour after dinner I found myself in bed. The
window of my chamber was wide open, an old lancet
window of Norman days, one out of which Roger de
Montgomery may have gazed, and, later, many of the
Henry’s of England in succession. All was very still
outside. In the little bit of dark sapphire-blue sky
that met my eye as I lay in bed, I saw a mist of
silver stars, and the scent of the creepers entered with
entrancing sweetness. I was no longer in pain, but not
sleepy, so I stretched out my hand and took hold of a
book. My hand closed upon a volume of Milton, well
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_314' id='Page_314'>314</a></span>
worn, and much used; for John Milton has a solemn,
sacred power, and touches you with the solemnity of
some grand chords heard upon a cathedral organ, and
the melody of his verse is often welcome in this holy
place. But it was not to his “Paradise Lost” or
“Regained” that I turned, nor to his exquisite sonnets.
I was in a lighter mood; I turned to the most beautiful
masque that ever was written; whilst I thought of the
most beautiful of all ruins, Ludlow Castle, the early
home of Sir Philip Sidney, England’s ideal knight, and
the mirror of her chivalry.</p>

<p class='c014'>The plot of the masque arose from a simple little
mishap which happened in the life of the actors. John
Milton was then tutor to the Earl of Bridgewater’s sons,
Lord Brackley and Thomas Egerton. On their way to
Ludlow, the young party went through Haywood Forest
in Herefordshire. Travelling with her brothers was
the Lady Alice Egerton. Somehow, in the depth of the
wilderness, the young lady was lost for a short time.</p>

<p class='c014'>Out of this slender plot Milton constructed his
masque of “Comus.” His friend, Henry Lawes, set
his songs to music, and the fair Alice and her two
brothers all appeared in the play on Michaelmas night
and acted at Ludlow Castle before their parents and
assembled guests. As I lay in bed the grace and the
charm of the masque returned to me. I thought in
the tranquillity of the summer evening I heard the
lady calling—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that lives unseen</div>

      <div class='line in8'>Where the love-lorn nightingale</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE MASQUE OF “COMUS”</div>

<p class='c014'>How prettily the lines must have sounded, not
through wood and glade, but through the stately presence
chamber of Ludlow Castle to the graceful tinkling
music Lawes had written for them. The earl and
countess sat, I have read, in all the state of the Marches
Court in the front row, and were surrounded by neighbours
and dependents. There is the grace of great
things in “Comus,” and a grace and finished purity of
soul that have seldom belonged to youth.</p>

<p class='c014'>The elder brother’s speech is worthy of Shakespeare—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

<p class='c014'>What happened to fair Alice, I have often asked
myself, in the time of trouble that was soon to come? I
have never been able to find out much, save that she
married Lord Carberry, and lived with him at his seat
of Golden Grove.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the unbroken calm, the old world seemed very
near me. Ghosts, once dear to Ludlow, seemed to
breathe around me. The little princes, with their fair
curls, smiled upon me from the threshold of life; Prince
Arthur, Sir Philip Sidney, Alice and her brothers, and
Milton in the dawn of his poet’s career; ill-fated Charles;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_316' id='Page_316'>316</a></span>
and brilliant, but broken-hearted, Butler. I thought of
all of them, whilst the wind stirred faintly the summer
leaves. At last I sank into repose. Sweet dreams are
those suggested by old-world ghosts, and when the
spirit is lulled by the graces of another age. I lay
half-dreaming, half-awake, and thought of John Milton,
young and beautiful, with the fire of inspiration in his
deep grey-blue eyes. A man of wonderful learning
and grace. A master swordsman, inasmuch as it was
true of him “that he was not afraid of resenting an
affront from any man.” Of deep erudition, for Hebrew,
Chaldee, and Syriac were all known to him, besides
being well versed in Italian, French, and Spanish. He
could repeat aloud, I have heard, many portions of
Homer. I thought of him later giving himself up to
the delights of music, of which he was a master, as
was his father; playing, it is said, both on the organ
and on other instruments. He was also a composer,
like his friend Henry Lawes, though none of his compositions
have reached us. Certainly, as Bishop Newton
wrote of him, “he was a man of great parts, for his
was a quick apprehension, a sublime imagination, a
strong memory, a piercing judgment, and a wit always
ready.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The next day I sat out after breakfast. It was
delicious weather. Soft rain had fallen during the
night towards dawn, and refreshed the earth. I had
begun to answer letters on a little bed-table, when my
solitude was interrupted by the appearance of Auguste.
He approached my couch with a profound bow. Under
his arm was a book bound in vellum, and bearing on
the side an inscription in manuscript. He advanced,
placed both heels together, and then bowed profoundly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame se porte mieux?</span>” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_317' id='Page_317'>317</a></span>
I replied in the affirmative, and thanked him for his
kind enquiries.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="fr">L’ŒUVRE DE GRAND-PAPA</div>

<p class='c014'>There was a pause; then Auguste bowed again, and
after a long string of courteous words, in which our cook
trusted that “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le bon Dieu ferait vite son métier,</span>” and
in which he assured me that he prayed that I should
be soon restored to health, he put beside me “le
cahier blanc” that he had been holding. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est l’œuvre
de mon grand-père,</span>” he explained with pride. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il était
cuisinier dans la famille d’un maréchal de l’Empire,</span>”
and added, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame peut copier ce dont elle a besoin.</span>”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt overwhelmed at this proposal, for I realized
that poor Auguste was giving me what he prized most
in the world. Perhaps the great Napoleon had supped
off grandpapa’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrées</span></i>, or Josephine had tasted an ice
or some <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brioche</span></i> made by grandpapa’s hands. These
recipes have for Auguste the mysticism of the lore of
Merlin. They are, in his words, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">magnifiques</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">superbes</span></i>,
and the last words of culinary art. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mes secrets,</span>” he
generally calls them. Grand’maman bound them in
white vellum, and the book has been handed down as a
priceless heirloom in Auguste’s family.</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt I could hardly thank my cook sufficiently for
his kind thought. There Auguste stood in irreproachable
white linen cap and coat. No prince could have
believed that he could offer a more splendid gift,
as he repeated, with a theatrical wave of his hand,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame peut tout copier.</span>” And then added, with
an indulgent smile, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame est malade, cela lui fera
un plaisir énorme.</span>”</p>

<p class='c014'>I rose to the occasion and said, as “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne ménagère.</span>”
I found it difficult to express my gratitude.</p>

<p class='c014'>At this Auguste retired a step, and then, with
a courtly bow, exclaimed grandly, his eye upon my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_318' id='Page_318'>318</a></span>
embroidery which lay near on a chair, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut que les
artistes se consolent dans les jours de tristesse,</span>” and
so saying, vanished to reign over his own kingdom.</p>

<p class='c014'>A little later Burbidge came in to see me. In his
hand he held a bunch of roses, neatly tied with green
matting, a new fad of mine. Amongst the roses that
he had brought me, I found a lovely Caroline Testout,
of great size and beauty, of a delicate pink with a glow
of richer colour in the centre. Then there was an open
bud of charming Thérèse Levet, and a full blown splendour
of Archiduchesse Marie Immaculata, with its
curious red-brick tints; and two or three blossoms of
the dear old-fashioned Prince Camille de Rohan of a
deep, brownish crimson hue.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here’s a few on ’em, just a sprinklin’,” said Burbidge.
“But oh, ’tis a pity as yer can’t see ’em growin’!
The sop of rain has brought ’em out, like the sunshine
brings out chickens from under a hen’s wing. They be
popping and peering in the garden, as if they had the
Lord Almighty to look at ’em Hisself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps He is,” I said with a smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>To this Burbidge didn’t give direct assent, but like a
true Shropshire man, he declared that it was his belief,
if the Lord was on earth, it might pleasure Him to see
the place, for the whole of the red-walled garden was
a garland of flowers. “There be irises, and roses, and
peonies; and it be hard to tell the colours. There be
all sorts and all shades, most like a glass window in the
Abbey Church at Shrewsbury.” And Burbidge added,
with that true sense of poetry that belongs to the peasant,
that “the Wrekin doves they be cooing and fluttering
round the firs, same as in a real poem.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A POSY OF ROSES</div>

<p class='c014'>Burbidge laid the bunch of roses close beside me,
for they had slipped off the sofa whilst he was talking.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_319' id='Page_319'>319</a></span>
Before going, he vouchsafed the information that there
be a Reine d’Angleterre three parts in blow. He pronounced
the French words strangely, but I understood
from many talks what was meant in Gallic, and that he
would bring it to me. “And ’tis a great deal, I think, the
sight of a new rose—leastways, ’tis to me; for it allus
pleases, and it never can be uncivil like many Christians,”
he said. After which profound dictum, my good old
gardener hobbled off. These kind gifts and little
attentions touched me. I appreciated much Auguste’s
thoughtful kindness, and Burbidge’s pity for my misfortune,
for it was his invariable rule that a “first
blow,” must show itself first in a garden. “Don’t ’e
interfere with the Lord’s system,” he once said to me,
when I wanted to gather a new tree peony. “Let it
pleasure itself first time in the garden, and arter yer
may please yerself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I smelt my bunch of roses, the fragrance was delicious,
soft and sweet, and only to be fully appreciated by
dipping one’s nose well into the centre of the sweetest.</p>

<p class='c014'>Certainly a rose is a lovely flower, and it is wonderful
what gardeners have done to tend, improve, and develop
it, and it was hard to imagine that any of the great
double complex blossoms that I held in my hand, were
first cousin, and lineally descended from the wild rose
of the hedges. Yet delicious as roses are, and beloved by
most men, and women, there have been, and may be, for
aught I know, some who still cordially hate them, as
cordially as Lord Roberts is said to dislike the presence
of a cat, or a certain Duchess that I have been told of,
the approach of horses.</p>

<p class='c014'>Marguerite of Navarre, the wife of Henry IV. of France,
is said to have found the perfume of roses so repellent, that
she fainted if one was brought her; and I remember in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_320' id='Page_320'>320</a></span>
Evelyn’s Diary of 1670, an account of a dinner-party
at Goring House, in which he tells us that, “Lord
Stafford rose from table in some disorder, because there
were roses stuck about the fruit at dessert.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir Kenelm Digby also told a story of the same kind
of Lady Selenger (St. Leger). Her antipathy to this
flower he declared to have been so great, that some one
laying a rose beside her cheek when asleep, thereby
caused a blister to rise. Whether the story was true
it is too long ago to tell; but by all accounts Sir
Kenelm “was a teller of strange things.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Whilst I was thinking over these old-world stories,
I was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of my little
girl.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, mamma,” cried Bess, with tears in her eyes,
“only to think he—Hals—has to go, to go in two days.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do not cry, little one,” I replied. “Papa and I
have settled that I am to go off for a week to the seaside,
and you shall come too; and even Mouse shall
have her ticket.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this Bess was comforted, for the prospect of the
sea, the sands, and a spade of her very own, were very
consolatory. But the day that little Hals left us, she
came to me just before going off to bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mum,” she said, “I’ve been thinking.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, dear,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve been thinking,” pursued Bess, “that somehow
there ought to be—a way to keep a boy. Grown-up
girls have husbands, I know,” she said. Then, after
a momentary pause, “You have a great, great book of
Harrod’s. Surely, somewhere, mamsie, they have a
boy stall.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I laughed and kissed my little girl. “We are poor
creatures,” I said, “we girls and women. We have all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_321' id='Page_321'>321</a></span>
for centuries wanted to buy some boy, and haven’t yet
found out where or how to do it.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“GOOD-BYE! GOOD-BYE!”</div>

<p class='c014'>A few days later, Bess and I found ourselves on the
Wenlock station platform. Masses of boxes surrounded
us, and Mouse, with a label tied to her collar, sat
watching us intently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why aren’t you glad to go—glad as I am,
mamsie?” cried Bess, impetuously. “You know the
doctor said that it would make you quite better, and
we can bathe together in the sea. Besides,” added
my little maid, with wisdom beyond her years, “if you
only go, you are always much gladder to come back.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We jumped into a carriage, and Mouse looked out of
the window. Burbidge took my last injunctions. Then
the train moved off, and the ruins and old town of
Wenlock faded before my eyes. “Good-bye, dear old
place!” I murmured. And as we dashed on, faintly
sounding on the breeze, I caught the last notes of the
distant chimes—“Good-bye! Good-bye!”</p>

</div>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c023'>This volume is intended to form a summary guide
to the vast and varied contents of the Dictionary and
its Supplement. Every name, about which substantive
biographic information is given in the sixty-three
volumes in the Dictionary or in the three Supplementary
Volumes, finds mention here in due alphabetical
order. An Epitome is given of the leading
facts and dates that have been already recorded at
length in the pages of the original work, and there is
added a precise reference to the volume and page
where the full article appears.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'><i>ATHENÆUM.</i>—‘The appearance of this supplement to the “Dictionary of
National Biography” puts the coping-stone upon a work which is justly regarded as
a national possession.... We can, indeed, conceive no volume of reference more
indispensable to the scholar, literary man, the historian, and the journalist.’</p>

<p class='c014'><i>OUTLOOK.</i>—‘A complete biographical dictionary, containing names and references,
to be counted literally by the thousand, altogether inaccessible inside the covers of any
other single volume.... The EPITOME is worthy of the DICTIONARY. Could
greater praise be given?’</p>

<p class='c014'><i>TIMES.</i>—‘This newly-published INDEX AND EPITOME may seem a mere
trifle compared to the rest, but is, in fact, a remarkable piece of work.... As far as we
have been able to test it this design has been so admirably carried out as to give the
work a real value and importance of its own.’</p>

<p class='c014'><i>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE.</i>—‘A volume of the highest practical utility....
We have tested the work by several consultations, and have found it answer exactly to
the excellent plan outlined in its preface.’</p>

<p class='c014'><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>—‘This final volume will convince every one of the
Dictionary’s wonderful utility, and indeed introduce the work to many who may not
be able to afford the original volumes.’</p>

<p class='c014'><i>SCOTSMAN.</i>—‘This volume of the Dictionary will soon be the best-thumbed of
them all. Only long and frequent use upon particular occasions fully tests a book
of this kind; but it needs no very exhaustive scrutiny to reveal that the EPITOME
is a work well organised, of exact learning, and of a careful compilation. Useful in
itself, it must largely enhance the usefulness of the Dictionary which it serves.’</p>
